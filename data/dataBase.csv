​We’re excited to invite you to a private gathering of senior engineering and technology executives at the Unusual Ventures Thought Leadership Dinner. This exclusive event is designed to catalyze strategic conversations at the intersection of AI, privacy, and data security—where emerging risks meet transformative opportunities.

​You’ll be joining a select group of 16 technology leaders, including:

​John Vrionis, Managing Partner, Unusual Ventures
Niamh O'Donnell, Director of Programs, Unusual Ventures
Abhi Sharma, CEO and Co-Founder, Relyance AI

​Additional guests include top engineering and security minds from leading AI-forward organizations.

​Venue details will be shared directly with registered attendees.

​Topic: The Convergence of Privacy, Data Security, and AI Governance

​As generative and agentic AI systems increasingly influence core business operations, enterprises face a critical challenge: balancing innovation with accountability. The convergence of privacy, data security, and AI governance is no longer a theoretical discussion—it’s a boardroom mandate.

​Next-generation AI architectures require more than technical sophistication; they demand trust, transparency, and resilience. Privacy-preserving machine learning, secure model training, and real-time risk detection are rapidly becoming table stakes. Simultaneously, regulatory expectations around explainability, consent, and data lineage are reshaping how engineering leaders must design and deploy AI systems.

​For Heads of ML, CISOs, and technology executives, this moment calls for intentional leadership:

​How do we build systems that are not only intelligent, but inherently trustworthy?

​How do we future-proof our data and AI pipelines for a fragmented global compliance landscape?

​And how can we embed governance into AI development without slowing down innovation?

​This executive roundtable will unpack these strategic imperatives:

​What architectural principles drive AI systems that are secure, private by design, and auditable at scale?

​How can companies align AI governance with data strategy to create sustainable competitive advantage?

​What best practices are emerging across high-stakes industries—and what lessons can we learn from early adopters?

​Join us for a candid, high-impact discussion on operationalizing trustworthy AI at scale—where security, privacy, and governance are not afterthoughts, but foundational design pillars.",2025-07-02T01:30:00.000Z

Turn your Codex agents into a production-grade coding team with a cloud backend,https://lu.ma/xpander-ai-agentops-workshop,"This workshop teaches developers how to deploy and manage open-source Codex coding agents in a production-ready cloud environment using xpander.ai and AgentOps.ai for scalability, observability, and collaboration, transforming individual agents into a fully functional team.  Attendees will build and deploy cloud-based agent workflows in a hands-on session, requiring laptops and specific pre-installed extensions.","AWS Builder Loft, 525 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA",California,xpander.ai,2025-07-03,05:30 AM,"July 02, 2025",20:30,Tech & AI,0.0,"​Open-source coding agents are ready for production - if you give them the runtime they deserve.

​​If you’ve already tried Codex, you know it’s powerful - but turning it into a reliable developer sidekick requires significant effort. You’ll need to manage sessions, handle long-running tasks, secure sandbox and terminal access, integrate with third-party services like GitHub and deal with A2A to allow multi-agents deployments so you can build a team of coding agents.

​​This workshop is for developers and AI agent builders who want to run open-source coding agents in the cloud, as part of a team, with the right infrastructure behind them.

​​We’ll walk through how to take local coding agents and run them with a proper backend: secure runtimes, persistent memory, triggers via MCP right from your IDE, and multi-agent orchestration using A2A (Agent-to-Agent). No more running brittle scripts on your laptop. No more glue code. Just real infrastructure, ready to scale your agents from toy to teammate.

​​We’ll use xpander.ai, backend-as-a-service for agents, to set up, deploy, and orchestrate coding agents that can interact, share state, and get real work done even when you're offline. We’ll use AgentOps for observability, to monitor, debug, and understand our AI agents' behavior with time-travel session replays, prompt-level insights, and detailed traces of tool calls, errors, and token usage.

​​In under three hours, you’ll go from zero to running agent workflows that are cloud-deployed, event-triggered, and fully observable.

​​Agenda:

​​5:00–5:30 PM | Gathering, snacks, networking
5:30–5:50 PM | Tech talk 1: The three most important things you need for running coding agents in the cloud
5:50–6:10 PM | Demo 1: xpander.ai
6:10–6:30 PM | Demo 2: AgentOps.ai
6:30–8:00 PM | Hands-on workshop - build it on your own
7:00 | Pizza is served 🍕
8:00–8:30 PM | Progress check-in and wrap-up

​Speakers: Sonali Mishra & Shalin Patel (Nutanix)
Abstract: Handling workloads that require GPU on Kubernetes has become easier with tools like NVIDIA’s GPU Operator but deploying them in production across real-world environments brings hidden challenges. In this session, we will share lessons learned from managing GPU across different infrastructures including on-prem and across public clouds, air-gapped environments, and different Operating Systems. We will cover compatibility issues with drivers and runtimes, discovering GPU attached nodes and scheduling GPU workloads on Kubernetes clusters. We will also discuss our experience working with vGPUs, the challenges of enabling multi-tenancy, dynamic resource allocation and monitoring. And lastly, we will talk about how we addressed some of these challenges using the NVIDIA GPU operator and our Kubernetes operator for vGPU tokens and license management. This talk is ideal for platform engineers and architects bringing AI/ML to Kubernetes, and looking to scale GPU use efficiently, securely and with better observability.

This is Day 1 of this movement, and we at Hyperspace welcome everyone tinkering, thinking about, or building components for it to come together.

We also have some exclusive and priority access and rewards planned for those who RSVP-ed early. - Varun

​A backstory on why we at Hyperspace have been building it:

​the idea of an agentic browser pokes at the idea of how do the agents rank and utilize each other in order to best serve users. we believe this compounds user utility over time. Search engines have built-in network effects: more people use the web, the smarter they (ought to) become with more credible websites “voting” for webpages in an uber-democratic real-time process. this compounds and compresses society’s knowledge.

​is it true with single-shot AI answer engines which are wrapping search results ? you ask a question, get generated answer and move on - how does that feedback into making the underlying system a lot smarter over time ? what has it learnt about that page compared to other pages which fundamentally improves the experience for the Nth user ?

​for example - consider the “rental car” problem. 

​1) enter that term in a search engine like Google, what do you get ? list of top car rental websites

​2) enter it in an answer engine, what do you get ? you get English-ized version of (1) above. great, now you know the names of the biggest rental car companies in the US. as a user, you are basically back at (1) above. 

​what did you as a user really want ? you wanted the best rental car options for you and also things happening leading to a booking: based on your needs and preferences. so right answer for you would have been a series of actions:

​- a question: which city do you need this in and approximately when ? what kind of cars do you like to drive ? 

​- found you these Tesla Model 3 rentals, available on these dates for this price, and booking available on these few websites and apps, 

​- and i will re-run this analysis every 30 mts for next 2 weeks until your travel to see if can find you a better price and negotiate behind the scenes 

​this, is the next society productivity unlock as this is the flow the user would have been the MOST happiest with. that is the 5 star user experience. and that’s only going to happen in the most seamless way in a software system custom-designed for this purpose, an agentic browser, which leverages AI agents (nameless processes recursively spanning and orchestrating themselves using all types of infrastructure necessary in order to satisfy the user need). 

​where a search engine and an answer engine “gives up” after showing rudimentary options, the agentic browser is a relentless beast of a machine which keeps on running and processing, and orchestrating many agents together into getting the job done for the user. during this time, it is learning and compounding on the nature of agents and their interactions themselves’. it is not just a standalone software, but a network, and it requires a different DNA altogether. 

​this is the world we are building, and it spans many components: from a revolutionary new user interface, to insanely powerful on-device capabilities, to plugging into the world’s largest distributed data and compute cluster, and using the right decentralized protocols for agent-to-agent transactions and payments to build trust in the system. 

​this is going to be the largest new economy built from scratch this decade.",2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z

Details:

​When: Saturday, July 19, 2025, 10:00 am to 5:30 pm

​Where: Sentry HQ – 45 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA

​Host: SF Bay Area Ruby Meetup

​Who: Open to all Rubyists & friends in the Bay Area at any experience level

​Teams: Solo or teams up to 3 people – your choice

​Entry fee: None!

​Food: TBD (we’re working on it!)

​Prizes: TBD (we’re working on prizes, too!)

​Rails as the One Person Framework

​AI-assisted coding has exploded onto the scene, promising to amplify what solo devs can do. Ruby on Rails is the perfect partner for this approach. Rails has long been known as the one-person framework, a powerful toolkit designed to give lone developers and small teams superpowers, compressing the time and knowledge needed to ship big features

​This Ruby AI hackathon is about exploring that vision: how AI can make building a Rails app even more of a one-person show! Some participants might even experiment with voice coding setups – it’s all about exploring new ways to build with Ruby.

​Current plans

​You can work solo as part of a small team. Bring your own application idea to life or choose from several project prompts we’ll provide if you need inspiration. Throughout the day, mentors will be on hand to help with technical issues, brainstorm AI solutions, or just cheer you on. We’re working on bringing special guests from the Ruby AI community joining as mentors and judges.

​As an all-day event, we’ll have breaks for lunch and snacks. At the end of the day, each individual or team will get to demo their app and briefly show off their code. A panel of judges will evaluate each project and provide encouraging feedback. They’ll be looking at creativity, use of the theme, and technical achievement given the time constraints.

​Ready to hack? RSVP now!

​Sounds exciting? We sure hope so! RSVP on our Meetup page here so we can get a headcount. If you have any questions, feel free to drop by our Ruby SF Slack channel. Otherwise, just bring your laptop on July 19 and get ready to code with vibes.",2025-07-19T17:00:00.000Z

Next Protest at OpenAI,https://lu.ma/rxyplaok,"This protest aims to shut down OpenAI, citing existential risks associated with the company's pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

​​​​Help us say, ""Close OpenAI!"" OpenAI is the company leading the race to smarter-than-human AI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), i.e., an AI that is smarter than all human experts across all technical domains. 2,700 cited AI researchers said in a poll that there is a 19% chance of AGI causing human extinction, and Geoffrey Hinton, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in AI in 2024, says there is a 50% chance of AGI causing human extinction. Some experts, like Dr. Roman Yampolskiy, say the risk of extinction is 99.99%. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, when asked about the worst case for AGI, said it could be, ""lights out for all of us."" Sam Altman has also said AGI will arrive in 2025. It is impossible to have experimental evidence that the behavior of an AGI will stay safe indefinitely and that AGI will never want something that will lead to our extinction similar to how we as Homo Sapiens often caused the extinction of many less intelligent species.

"Lunch with Mike Grunwald, ""We Are Eating the Earth""",https://lu.ma/86m5afua,"Join climate journalist Mike Grunwald for a book launch discussion of ""We Are Eating the Earth,"" exploring the urgent need to reform our food system to combat climate change.  Grunwald will discuss innovative solutions and the challenges of balancing food production with environmental sustainability. Ideal for climate activists, food system professionals, and anyone concerned about the future of our planet.","9Zero Climate Innovation Hub, 350 California St 4th floor, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",California,9Zero Climate Innovation Hub - San Francisco,2025-07-18,01:00 AM,"July 17, 2025",13:30,Networking & Community,0.0,"​Bring your lunch and join climate journalist and author Mike Grunwald at 9Zero SF for a discussion and celebration of the launch of his new book, ""We Are Eating the Earth,"" available on July 1!

​About the book:

​From the author of New York Times bestseller The New New Deal, a groundbreaking piece of reportage from the trenches of the next climate war: the fight to fix our food system.

Humanity has cleared a land mass the size of Asia plus Europe to grow food, and our food system generates a third of our carbon emissions. By 2050, we’re going to need a lot more calories to fill nearly 10 billion bellies, but we can’t feed the world without frying it if we keep tearing down an acre of rainforest every six seconds. We are eating the earth, and the greatest challenge facing our species will be to slow our relentless expansion of farmland into nature. Even if we quit fossil fuels, we’ll keep hurtling towards climate chaos if we don’t solve our food and land problems.

In this rollicking, shocking narrative, Grunwald shows how the world, after decades of ignoring the climate problem at the center of our plates, has pivoted to making it worse, embracing solutions that sound sustainable but could make it even harder to grow more food with less land. But he also tells the stories of the dynamic scientists and entrepreneurs pursuing real solutions, from a jungle-tough miracle crop called pongamia to genetically-edited cattle embryos, from Impossible Whoppers to a non-polluting pesticide that uses the technology behind the COVID vaccines to constipate beetles to death. It’s an often infuriating saga of lobbyists, politicians, and even the scientific establishment making terrible choices for humanity, but it’s also a hopeful account of the people figuring out what needs to be done—and trying to do it.

Michael Grunwald, bestselling author of The Swamp and The New New Deal, builds his narrative around a brilliant, relentless, unforgettable food and land expert named Tim Searchinger. He chronicles Searchinger’s uphill battles against bad science and bad politics, both driven by the overwhelming influence of agricultural interests. And he illuminates a path that could save our planetary home for ourselves and future generations—through better policy, technology, and behavior, as well as a new land ethic recognizing that every acre matters.

​Are you in touch with yours?

​Is your heart open?

​Are you living well?

​What is yours to do?

​The future of wisdom is a bit of a misnomer, because on a certain level there is no future just as there is no past. It is all contained right now in the present moment.

​While AI can increasingly handle intellectual tasks and reasoning, it can’t replicate your own deep attunement to your own human wisdom, which comes from having a body. This ""inner knowing"" — alongside discernment, presence, and expanded consciousness — is a valuable currency in a world overflowing with cheap content. 

​Come rediscover your own soul's signal in all the noise. Join us for a short talk followed by guided meditation designed to reconnect you with yourself.

​Who should come: Seekers, dreamers, visionaries. People who want to connect to their hearts and not just their minds.

​

​Who We Are

​

​We got sick of just getting fucked up every Friday, so we launched monthly Tinker Nights! Instead of hitting the usual bar scene, we’ve created a chill space for folks to build, create, and connect. We’re all about tinkering, making cool stuff, and finding cool people to hangout. .

​

​Who You Are

​

​You’re someone who loves to create, tinker, and learn in a laid-back environment with awesome people. You’re curious, eager to share what you’ve learned, and don’t make a big fuss about it. You just want a fun space to build and vibe.

​

​What We’re Tinkering On This Month

​

​Beginner Workshop: Control an LED with AI Voice Commands

​

​You’ll be using AI and your voice to control real-world electronics! In this hands-on workshop, you’ll build a project that lets you turn an LED on or off just by saying things like “Turn on the light” — no buttons needed.

​

​You’ll learn how to:

​

​•  Set up an ESP32 microcontroller with a built-in LED

​•  Build a simple web interface using HTML and JavaScript

​•  Use your phone or browser to capture voice input

​•  Process natural language with AI tools (like ChatGPT or simple logic)

​•  Send commands to the ESP32 over Wi-Fi

​•  Add spoken feedback with text-to-speech

​

​By the end, you’ll have a working voice-controlled LED system and the skills to create your own AI-powered IoT projects. No prior AI experience needed — just bring your curiosity and a laptop!

​

​Food & Drinks

​Talks

​Philip Kiely @ Baseten - Five things to know about AI infrastructure as you scale

​In 2025, AI-native startups are scaling to 8 figures of annual revenue in months. How do you build infrastructure that keeps up with this explosive growth? This talk provides five sometimes-surprising solutions selected from the hardest challenges we’ve faced while working on scaling fast-growing AI startups.

​Michael N Magan @ Tambo.co - Generative UI in Practice: From Intent to Interface

​Generative UI lets AI assistants surface real UI such as charts, forms, and complete workflows exactly when users need them. This talk shows how it works by treating components as tools: mapping user intent to the right component, binding data, and rendering on the fly. A demo of how we use it internally. I'll close with the main opportunities, and the chief challenges. Attendees leave knowing what generative UI is, why it matters, and how to ship it.

​SallyAnn DeLucia @ Arize - Evaluating Agents in the Wild with Arize

​This talk will demo how Arize supports agent evaluation with a focus on strategy and visibility. I’ll walk through our new Agent View, which aggregates traces, tool use, and reasoning steps into a structured, searchable format—making it easier to debug failures, track performance, and iterate on agent design.

AI Product Building Workshop @ Stanford,https://lu.ma/rgmuemy7,"Stanford-hosted workshop led by Alex Dang (Amazon exec, McKinsey advisor) reveals 7 common pitfalls in AI product development, offering practical strategies for building successful AI products.  Attendees learn to avoid costly mistakes through proven frameworks and actionable tools, accelerating their product launch and market success.  Ideal for startup founders and anyone serious about shipping effective AI products, not just conceptualizing them.",Santa Clara County,,Bay Area Founders Club,2025-07-06,06:30 AM,"July 05, 2025",20:00,Startup & Entrepreneurship,19800.0,"​Building AI Products That Win: Avoid the 7 Mistakes That Kill Your Products

​With Alex Dang – Stanford Alumni, Former Amazon Exec, McKinsey Advisor, and Co-Author of The Venture Mindset 

​🔥 Why This Workshop Matters

​Everyone’s building AI products and services — but most products still fail.
Why? It’s not the tech. It’s the product thinking.

​Join Alex Dang, Silicon Valley strategist and co-author of the global bestseller The Venture Mindset, for a no-fluff, high-impact workshop on what really separates winning AI products from the ones that never ship—or worse, launch and flop.

​You’ll learn the 7 deadly mistakes that kill AI projects—and how to avoid them using the same tools that helped scale ideas at Amazon and drive innovation with Fortune 500s and startups alike.

​This workshop is battle-tested, hands-on, and designed for builders who want to move faster without wasting time on the wrong things.

​🧠 What You’ll Learn

​• How to stress-test clarity and ambition of your idea

​• How to run fast MVP tests (without overbuilding)

​• How to identify and design for edge cases

​• Why simple hacks often beat complex models

​• Why storytelling and demos matter more than feature lists

​• How to reimagine, not just automate

​• And most importantly: how to pick a problem worth solving

​You’ll leave with a framework, tools, and mental models you can apply immediately—whether you’re shipping your first prototype or your tenth investor update.

​👤 Who Should Join

​• Startup founders

​• Anyone ready to stop talking about AI — and start shipping smarter

​​📖 Presentation Details

​💡 Meet You in the Middle: 1000× Performance for Parquet Queries on PB-Scale Data Lakes

​Storing data as Parquet files on S3 is increasingly used not just as a data lake but also as a lightweight feature store for ML training/inference or a document store for RAG. However, querying petabyte- to exabyte-scale data lakes directly from cloud object storage remains notoriously slow (e.g., latencies ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to several seconds on AWS S3).

​In this talk, we show how architecture co-design, system-level optimizations, and workload-aware engineering can deliver over 1000× performance improvements for these workloads—without changing file formats, rewriting data paths, or provisioning expensive hardware.

​We introduce a high-performance, low-latency S3 proxy layer powered by Alluxio, deployed atop hyperscale data lakes. This proxy delivers sub-millisecond Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB)—on par with Amazon S3 Express—while preserving compatibility with standard S3 APIs. In real-world benchmarks, a 50-node Alluxio cluster sustains over 1 million S3 queries per second, offering 50× the throughput of S3 Express for a single account, with no compromise in latency.

​Beyond accelerating access to Parquet files byte-to-byte, we also offload partial Parquet processing from query engines via a pluggable interface into Alluxio. This eliminates the need for costly index scans and file parsing, enabling point queries with 0.3 microseconds latency and up to 3,000 QPS per instance (measured using a single-thread)—a 100× improvement over traditional query paths.

​💡 Introduction to Apache Iceberg™ & Tableflow

​The data lake is a fantastic, low-cost place to put data at rest for offline analytics, but we've built it under the terms of a terrible bargain: all that cheap storage at scale was a great thing, but we gave up schema management and transactions along the way. Apache Iceberg has emerged as king of the Open Table Formats to fix this very problem.

​Built on the foundation of Parquet files, Iceberg adds a simple yet flexible metadata layer and integration with standard data catalogs to provide robust schema support and ACID transactions to the once ungoverned data lake. In this talk, we'll build Iceberg up from the basics, see how the read and write path work, and explore how it supports streaming data sources like Apache Kafka™. Then we'll see how Confluent's Tableflow brings Kafka together with open table formats like Iceberg and Delta Lake to make operational data in Kafka topics instantly visible to the data lake without the usual ETL—unifying the operational/analytical divide that has been with us for decades.",2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z

​Join us at SF Athletic Club for a conversation with Dr. Kimberly Richman, professor of sociology and legal studies at the University of San Francisco, as we explore what happens when transgender people navigate the prison system—and what it takes to make it out.

​In this talk, we’ll take a closer look at how California’s parole system works—and what happens when transgender individuals come before the parole board to earn their release after long prison terms. Drawing from original research analyzing every transgender parole hearing in the state from 2021–2022, Dr. Richman will unpack what the data reveals about bias, reform, and the real-world barriers to freedom. 🧠⚖️

"Avoiding the Age of Ultron: Empathy, Antisociality, and AI",https://lu.ma/ygjpcdxv,"Cognitive scientist Roshni explores the crucial link between empathy and AI safety, using the ""Dark Triad"" personality framework to illuminate potential dangers of unemotional AI.

Attendees must be 21+ for this event at Wave Collective.","Madrone Art Bar, 500 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117, USA",California,,2025-07-31,07:30 AM,"July 30, 2025",21:00,Tech & AI,1000.0,"​🤖 What happens when intelligence lacks empathy?

​Join us at Wave Collective for a talk with cognitive scientist and AI researcher Roshni, whose work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and machine ethics.

​As artificial intelligence grows more powerful—and more human-like—we’re faced with an urgent question: how do we stop it from replicating the worst parts of ourselves? In this talk, Roshni explores what happens when machines mimic minds that are manipulative, narcissistic, or even psychopathic. Using the “Dark Triad” of human personality as a cautionary framework, she’ll take us inside the science of empathy—how it works in the brain, how it breaks down in antisocial individuals, and why it matters for the future of AI.

​Drawing on cutting-edge research in moral psychology, neuroimaging, and large language models, this talk offers a new lens on emotional intelligence—not just in humans, but in machines. From the alignment problem to the ethics of artificial personalities, we’ll explore what it takes to build AI that doesn’t just think—but cares. 🧠💻

You’ve got half a carrot, a block of slightly suspicious cheese, and a dash of optimism—but somehow, you whip up a feast. It’s a never-ending festival of creativity and thriftiness, where “fundraising” means selling an old guitar on eBay, and “marketing” means personally DMing strangers on LinkedIn at 2 a.m.

​​Bootstrapping isn’t just a funding strategy—it’s a mindset. It’s saying, “I’ll figure it out” when the odds are stacked and the bank account is laughing at you. It’s turning constraints into superpowers and setbacks into punchlines you’ll one day share on a TED stage. 

​​Because the truth is, when you’re bootstrapping, every little win feels like striking gold. And that’s the magic: making something extraordinary with nothing but grit, gumption, and a touch of caffeine-fueled genius.

​​Why Are We Organizing This Event?

​​This evening event is dedicated to empowering tech entrepreneurs with actionable strategies to successfully bootstrap their ventures in uncertain times.

​​Amidst an ongoing crisis in tech, we face unique challenges: reduced funding opportunities, heightened competition, and shifting market demands. Yet, adversity often drives creativity. Can you count? Then count on yourself and uncover a whole world of possibilities for how to generate revenue with little to no funding.

​​Through engaging talks, expert panel, and networking sessions, we’ll explore how to:

​​Build sustainable business models from the ground up.

​​Leverage alternative funding and growth strategies.

​​Maximize revenue with limited resources.

​​Tap into community support and collaborative ecosystems.

​​Whether you’re launching a startup or scaling an idea on a shoestring budget, this event will provide you inspiration to turn challenges into opportunities.

​​Join us to connect with like-minded entrepreneurs and industry experts, and discover how resilience and resourcefulness can lead to success in the tech world!

Ideal for those interested in social psychology, media bias, and political discourse.","The San Francisco Athletic Club, 1750 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA",California,,2025-07-11,07:30 AM,"July 10, 2025",21:00,Networking & Community,0.0,"​📰 Why do we believe fake news—even when we know better?

​Join us at SF Athletic Club for a talk with Stanford social psychologist Dr. Michael Schwalbe as we dive into the messy intersection of truth, identity, and political belief.

​In a time when misinformation spreads fast and facts feel negotiable, Dr. Schwalbe’s research asks a striking question: What matters more to people—the accuracy of a news story, or whether it aligns with their politics? Drawing on a large-scale study conducted around the 2020 U.S. presidential election, this talk explores how political alignment often outweighs truth in determining what we believe and share.

​We’ll unpack why even highly educated or analytically minded individuals fall prey to bias, why people tend to resist true stories that challenge their beliefs more than they embrace false ones that confirm them—and what it all means for democracy, media, and our collective sense of reality. 🧠📣

​With Alex Dang – Stanford Alumni, Former Amazon Exec, McKinsey Advisor, and Co-Author of The Venture Mindset 

​🔥 Why This Workshop Matters

​Everyone’s building AI products and services — but most products still fail.
Why? It’s not the tech. It’s the product thinking.

​Join Alex Dang, Silicon Valley strategist and co-author of the global bestseller The Venture Mindset, for a no-fluff, high-impact workshop on what really separates winning AI products from the ones that never ship—or worse, launch and flop.

​You’ll learn the 7 deadly mistakes that kill AI projects—and how to avoid them using the same tools that helped scale ideas at Amazon and drive innovation with Fortune 500s and startups alike.

​This workshop is battle-tested, hands-on, and designed for builders who want to move faster without wasting time on the wrong things.

​🧠 What You’ll Learn

​• How to stress-test clarity and ambition of your idea

​• How to run fast MVP tests (without overbuilding)

​• How to identify and design for edge cases

​• Why simple hacks often beat complex models

​• Why storytelling and demos matter more than feature lists

​• How to reimagine, not just automate

AI Email Outreach Workshop: How to Find and Reach Your Ideal Customer Using AI?,https://lu.ma/l50b6eue,"This workshop teaches participants to build an AI-powered email outreach tool using Google Suite, personalizing outreach at scale and improving connection rates.  Leveraging AI for research and customized messaging, it's ideal for founders, consultants, and anyone seeking to enhance their networking and outreach strategies.  No prior coding experience is needed.",,,Bay Area Founders Club,2025-07-13,03:30 AM,"July 12, 2025",17:00,Career & Skills,0.0,"​Hi, I’m Alec Walker (Founder & Co-President at Stanford Angels & Entrepreneurs Texas Chapter). I help run executive education sessions at Stanford’s d.school and at Google, and I help run a part of the Stanford Alumni Association focused on matching startups with angel investors. I’ve started and sold a couple of data science startups, and I’ve helped execute AI projects at companies like Dow, Intel, GM, and Chevron, among others.

​Instructor Video – Learn how this session turns ideas into action and builds a real tool you’ll actually use.

​These days, cold outreach is broken. Inboxes are flooded. People ignore messages—even good ones—because they feel templated, irrelevant, or inauthentic. What works now isn’t volume; it’s resonance. The best outreach feels warm—even if it’s your first message—because it’s tailored, thoughtful, and clearly comes from someone who gets it.

​That kind of outreach starts before you ever hit “send.” It begins with building a brand people can’t ignore. When you’ve got a clear message, a distinct tone, and a reason people should trust you, your emails don’t feel like cold calls. They feel like welcome introductions.

​Once you’ve built that brand, you can assemble a contact list that actually wants to hear from you—not just a spreadsheet of names, but a community of potential collaborators, customers, mentors, or investors who are more likely to open, engage, and respond.

​This workshop will show you how to do all of that—and how to automate it, responsibly. We’ll build a tool that uses AI to take your message, understand your tone, research your contacts, and generate bespoke emails that match what each individual recipient actually cares about.

​If you’re excited to learn how to use AI to actually do something for you—not just chat—I hope you’ll join my upcoming hands-on virtual workshop, where you’ll build your own AI-powered outreach tool using Google Suite and custom scripts. Heads up that you’ll also need to create an openrouter API which will cost you $5. Instead of sending generic content to everyone with classic “mail merge,” you’ll be able to craft one message and oversee AI as it customizes the content you’ll send out to each individual recipient. Sound helpful? Let’s build it together.

​This workshop is for you if:

​You’ve felt stuck reaching out to people—even when you know they should be interested.

​You’re sitting on a contact list you’ve never really activated.

​You’re curious about how AI can not just help write, but actually research and personalize at scale.

​You’re a great fit if:

​You want to connect more effectively with collaborators, investors, potential customers, or mentors.

​You like the idea of AI helping you write—but you want it to do more than spit out bland templates.

​You want to teach AI your tone, not just rely on generic prompts.

​You’d rather build something useful today than just talk about what’s possible.

​You might be:

​A startup founder gearing up to fundraise or sell

​A solo consultant trying to grow your pipeline

​A nonprofit leader looking to activate your network

​A curious technologist or creative excited about real-world automation

​In this interactive session, expect:

​Real tools, real use cases. You’ll set up a working script that connects to Google Sheets, learns your voice, researches contacts, and sends smart, personal emails.

​Live scripting and debugging. You’ll see behind the curtain. No black boxes—just transparent, vibe-coded AI magic using Google Apps Script and prompt engineering best practices.

​Beginner-friendly pace. No coding experience needed. If you’ve ever used Google Sheets and written an email, you’re good to go.

​A bit of laughter and experimentation. We’ll have fun, get creative, and learn to trust a process that feels more like collaborating with a smart assistant than filling out a rigid form.

​By the end, you’ll be able to:

​Identify and assemble a quality contact list

​Train AI to write in your voice

​Automatically research contacts and tailor messaging accordingly

​Generate and send custom outreach at scale, with subject lines that actually get clicks

​Receive a certificate upon completion of this workshop

​This isn’t just an email tool. It’s a confidence builder and a relationship accelerator.
If you’ve got a message worth spreading, we’ll help you make sure it lands.

""Imagination without reason is mere fancy, but reason without imagination is sterile. That is partly why scientists and philosophers alike have always used imaginary scenarios to help sharpen their ideas and push them to their limits."" - The Pig that Wants to be Eaten, by Julian Baggini

For this meeting (June 4), we'll be discussing the ethics of procreation and the non-identity problem:

​We'll take some time to review this primer on this issue: https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2014/02/27/non-identity-problem/

​It is recommended to also read this short article beforehand: https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil308/Parfit1.pdf

​Some examples of things we've discussed at past meetings:

​Could a vegetarian eat a pig with a clear conscience, if that pig wanted to be eaten?

​Does a person survive using a teleporter that destroys the body and recreates it with perfect fidelity?

​Does the existence of evil in the world pose a problem for belief in a benevolent God?

​We'll be meeting in the 550 Room (down the stairs on the North side). Contact me by text if you're having trouble finding the location.
