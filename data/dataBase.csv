Fireside Chat & Happy Hour: Evaluating AI-Native Companies & Beyond,https://lu.ma/2zj6j26p,"This fireside chat, hosted by Stifel, Resident Company Club, and IAMBIC, delves into the crucial distinction between AI-enhanced and truly AI-native companies, focusing on defensibility in a commoditized model market. Expert insights from a renowned investor and the CEO of IAMBIC, a TIME Best Invention, explore the potential of AI beyond software, particularly in physical product innovation. Primarily for investors and founders at the intersection of AI and physical products, a happy hour follows.","New York, New York",Not yet specified,Stifel Venture Banking,2025-07-08T22:00:00.000Z,2025-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,Finance & Business,0,"​Hosted by Stifel Venture Bank, Resident Company Club, and IAMBIC.

​Today’s AI conversations often start - and stall - at surface level. Investors are flooded with pitches that tout LLM integrations, image generation, or plug-and-play tools layered onto standard products. But in a world where access to core models is increasingly commoditized, the next great challenge is depth – and where that depth can be defensible.

​What makes a company truly AI-native – not just AI-enhanced? And what can be possible when AI moves beyond the screen and into the physical world?

​On July 8th, join Maeve Wang, Co-founder & CEO of IAMBIC, for a fireside chat moderated by David Bell, legendary early-stage investor and former Wharton professor. Known for backing some of the most iconic product-led companies of the last two decades, David brings a sharp investor’s lens to this moment in AI – asking the right questions about depth, defensibility, and full market potential. This conversation will explore:

​The difference between AI-enhanced and AI-native products

​What defensibility looks like when models are table stakes

​How investors should assess depth, integration, and staying power

​Why the physical world may be AI’s overlooked frontier

​This event is designed primarily for investors, with a happy hour to follow. Founders at the intersection of AI and physical product innovation are also encouraged to attend.

​About AI Agent Builders

​AI Agent Builders is a global meetup series for anyone creating or curious about AI agents in the enterprise. Whether you're a developer, data scientist, IT pro, or business stakeholder, you’re welcome. Bring a question, a prototype, or something you’re stuck on.

​Whether you're just starting your agentic journey or you're a seasoned builder, join us to share real-world learnings, discover best practices, and learn from each other's successes (and failures). We'll dive into the basics of agent development, explore new tools and protocols emerging in the space, discuss ethical considerations of building responsible AI agents, and discuss how to integrate different technologies in the broader AI ecosystem, and get hands-on with how to design, deploy, and manage AI agents.

​Our mission is simple: inspire innovation, upskill our community, and forge meaningful connections with fellow builders who are shaping the future of AI agents.

​Come as you are, bring your curiosity, and let's build something amazing together.

​🎤Apply to speak at our next meetup
​About this session:

​Autonomous agents are on the rise, disrupting industries and shaping decisions in ways we’re only beginning to understand. But who defines what an “ethical” agent is? What happens to equity, sustainability, access, and employment as this technology scales?

​In this discussion-based session, we’ll explore at a high level what is Agentic AI, and what are the opportunities and consequences of this technology. We will also dive into the practical – as data practitioners and AI leaders today, what can we do to ensure our teams build ethical GenAI projects while driving business value that impacts the bottom line.

​What are the consequences of agents replacing human roles—and how do we mitigate negative effects on equity and employment?

​What practices from traditional software and model governance should be rethought or discarded when it comes to agents?

​What does good governance look like for agents—beyond just model documentation?

​If these questions sound interesting, come join us! Bring your questions, ideas, and an open mind for engaging discussions with peers and a panel of leaders. This event is open to all genders and anyone curious about these topics — no prior knowledge needed.

Join us for a hackathon focused on advancing Voice AI through intelligent feedback loops and evaluation systems. Using ElevenLabs’ voice synthesis and LLMs, we’ll build adaptive voice agents that can self-diagnose and improve their own system prompts over time.

​Evaluating LLM systems is a major challenge—and we're tackling it head-on. Whether for interviews, data collection, or dynamic conversations, let’s create voice agents that don’t just talk, but continuously self-improve.

Who Should Join?
Engineers, prompt designers, LLM researchers, UX thinkers, conversation designers, and anyone curious about voice interfaces and AI feedback loops.

Come with a project idea, or find collaborators at the event. Solo? We'll help with team formation after kickoff.

Examples:

​Expert Interviewer: A voice agent that questions domain experts to capture both quantitative metrics and rich qualitative insights, then refines its questioning strategy through feedback‑driven prompt tuning.

​Learning Buddy: A voice companion that adapts tone, pacing, and complexity to the user’s comprehension level—self‑diagnosing and improving its system prompts from interaction history.

Ed Vessel's research explores the complex relationship between visual perception and aesthetic experiences, investigating how our brains transform what we see into what we appreciate. His work, using techniques like brain imaging and computational modeling, sheds light on the neural mechanisms underlying our appreciation of art and beauty. During this discussion, we will explore the fundamental question of why we find certain things aesthetically pleasing while others leave us indifferent and discover the surprising role of the brain's ""default mode network"" in our experience of compelling art. We will also examine what role technologies like AI and machine learning are playing in analyzing data and synthesizing new forms of aesthetic experiences. 

Join us at the Macktez office, after work, over light snacks and sips, for an evening that will illuminate the captivating interplay between our minds and the art we encounter.

How do you get inspired beyond trendy ideas? This Demo Night is the place. It’s a space for creators and builders to show off exciting projects they’ve completed or have significant traction, and to get feedback on the product or technical side.

​While many events focus on education, this one is exclusively for builders and creators. Write a description of what you want to showcase to apply to join us. This could be a surprisingly effective prompt, a time-saving workflow, stunning artwork, or functional agents—it should be usable or productive, not just an idea. If you’re creative and productive in a non-AI field and want to share a demo that could transition into AI, you’re welcome too.

​Unfortunately, space and attention time are limited, so the guest list is carefully curated.

🗓 5 hours · 💵 $500 · Live + Interactive

​GenAI is reshaping how data gets ingested, processed, and used — fast. If you're already working in data or ML infrastructure, this 5-hour deep dive will show you how to integrate GenAI directly into your ingestion ETL stack using real-world patterns that scale.

​This isn’t beginner content. It’s built for experienced engineers and architects who want to upgrade their systems, sharpen their skills, and see what it takes to bring GenAI into production — cleanly, scalably, and cost-effectively.

​⏱️ Format and Flow:

​Length: 5 hours
Cost: $500
This is a live, working session — part lecture, part architecture review, part code walkthrough. It’s interactive, paced for pros, and built to deliver value immediately.

​What we’ll cover:

​Designing containerized ingestion pipelines (Docker, ECS, Fargate, etc.)

​Using GenAI models (Claude, GPT, Bedrock) to parse and enrich raw data

​Batch-first architecture with a clear path to real-time

​Deploying scalable GenAI on AWS without blowing your budget

​This is for:

​Data and ML engineers building production pipelines

​Architects who want ready-to-deploy reference patterns

​Technical leads focused on modernizing their stack with GenAI

​You’ll walk away with:

​A deployable GenAI-powered ingestion architecture

​Sample code + infra templates (CloudFormation or Pulumi)

​AWS credits

​Curated GenAI + infra resources to go deeper

​Private Slack group access to keep learning with your instructor and cohort after the session

​Taught by MLOps Community

Ideal for those interested in FinTech, entrepreneurship, and social impact.",,"New York, New York",Tête-à-Tech,2025-08-28T23:00:00.000Z,2025-08-29T01:00:00.000Z,Finance & Business,0,"​Join Cindy Gallop (Founder and CEO of MakeLoveNotPorn) and Noah Landow (Founder and CEO at Macktez) for an informal conversation about the surprisingly complex, conservative, and convoluted financial services companies that together to form the secretive layers underpinning the electronic financial systems we take advantage of every day. Underneath the shiny Stripe, Apple Pay, Square and well-heeled Visa, MasterCard, and Amex, lies a sprawling world of companies and services that connect the world’s financial institutions to each other and you. 

​Cindy is an unabashed voice, advocating for more women founders, and embodying the principles for which she argues, for reform of this ever-more powerful industry. During this engaging conversation, we will explore how the poorly understood world of financial services controls what art is created, what companies are founded and funded, and what businesses are able to get the money they need to build exciting tools. Strange and surprisingly limitations and conventions abound in this space, hidden largely from view, and wrapped in euphemism and innuendo. It dictates who has access to resources, and gatekeeps access to reaching financial success across a spectrum of people and companies.

​Join us at the Macktez office, after work, over light snacks and sips, for a thought-provoking discussion on how a broader, deeper understanding of FinTech could enable positive change to create greater opportunities for equity in the decades ahead.

​​It’s more like a break where you kill two birds at once—you get your steps in and meet peers, without wasting time.

​​Why it’s better than a regular meetup

​​Meetups are a hit or miss. And even if it’s bad, you usually stay and end up thinking, I could’ve done more with that time.
With a power walk, even if you don’t vibe with the group, at least you got your steps in.

​Many people talk about it in superficial terms, but the American founding was an era that stretched out for decades.

​And maybe you know about 1776, maybe 1789. But what happened before, after, and in between those dates? Why is knowing any of this relevant for the modern day? Is it relevant to modern New York City?

​Come and spend two hours with Daniel and Maximum New York to get a condensed version of The Founding Forty: 1763-1803.

​This event will end with an exam to see what you retain. You don't have to take it—you can just come and watch/listen—but you can also treat this as an opportunity to learn more about the American Founding than most people know!

​Some general topics to explore before coming if you want:
​I. Introduction and “The Pamphlet Era,” 1763-1776

​What happened in the run-up to the war? What caused it? Could it have been prevented?

​The French and Indian War or the Seven Years’ War? perspectives from the U.S. and Europe.

​We have always blogged: what the Americans and British said to each other, and how they said it (pamphlets).

​II) The Revolutionary War and Confederal Era, 1776-1789

​A summary overview of the war.

​The Treaty of Paris, 1783.

​The French Revolution, compared with the American.

​What is a revolution? What ramifications does this question have for today?

​The dysfunction of the Articles of Confederation and the chaos of the 1780s.

​The Constitutional Convention of 1787, and the failed revision attempts before it.

​The adoption of the Constitution.

​III) Birth of the Modern System, 1789-1803, part 1

​The Bill of Rights.

​The doctrine of incorporation, Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore (1833).

For this ability, they became indispensable for basic biological research and hold great promise for future therapeutic applications. The same technologies are being utilized also in early human embryos for better understanding of key developmental regulators and DNA repair mechanisms. In the future, precise correction of specific genes might enable curing devastating diseases early in the development or decreasing the risks of certain diseases. Although continuous research is needed before such an intervention becomes safe, the first gene-edited babies were already born. This talk aims to contribute to the debate about human germline gene editing by putting it into a broader context of human biology, discussing the benefits, current limitations, and possible future alternatives leading to the prevention of genetic diseases.

​Join an exclusive gathering of marketing executives from NYC's fastest-growing companies as we explore how artificial intelligence is transforming small marketing teams into high-performance powerhouses. This summit is designed specifically for marketing leaders managing teams of 5-10 people who need to deliver enterprise-level results with startup-level resources.

​Why This Summit Matters Now

​The marketing landscape has fundamentally shifted. With economic pressures demanding greater efficiency and AI technology reaching unprecedented accessibility, marketing leaders can no longer afford to operate with traditional approaches. Companies implementing AI-driven marketing strategies are seeing 41% increases in performance metrics while reducing operational overhead. This isn't about replacing your team—it's about amplifying their capabilities exponentially.

​What You'll Discover

​Strategic AI Integration Framework: Learn how to identify which marketing functions benefit most from AI automation, from content creation and campaign management to analytics and customer engagement. Discover proven methodologies for integrating AI tools without disrupting existing workflows or overwhelming your team.

​Practical Implementation Roadmaps: Move beyond theoretical discussions to actionable strategies. Explore real-world case studies showing how marketing teams have successfully deployed AI for content generation, social media management, email automation, and predictive analytics. See concrete examples of ROI improvements and efficiency gains achieved by teams similar to yours.

​Team Transformation Strategies: Master the art of upskilling your existing team members to become AI-native marketers. Learn how to foster adoption, overcome resistance, and create systems that allow your team to focus on strategic thinking while AI handles routine execution.

​Technology Stack Optimization: Get hands-on exposure to the most effective AI marketing tools currently delivering results. From AI-powered content creation platforms to automated campaign optimization systems, discover which technologies provide the highest impact for small teams with limited budgets.

​While larger companies struggle with complex AI implementations across massive teams, smaller marketing organizations have a unique opportunity to become more agile and efficient than their enterprise competitors. This summit will show you how to leverage that advantage, turning your team's size from a limitation into a strategic strength.

​Real Results, Real Impact: Attendees will leave with immediately implementable strategies, vetted tool recommendations, and a clear 90-day action plan for AI integration. You'll join a network of forward-thinking marketing leaders who understand that the future belongs to teams that can do more with less—and do it better than anyone else.

DeSciNYC: Genome Editing in Early Human Embryos,https://lu.ma/descinyc37,"DeSciNYC hosted Stepan Jerabek, a leading researcher in human embryo genome editing, to discuss the ethical and scientific implications of this groundbreaking technology. The talk explored the potential for curing genetic diseases through gene editing while acknowledging the current limitations and ongoing ethical debates. This event is ideal for anyone interested in the future of genetics, bioethics, or developmental biology.",,"New York, New York",DeSciNYC,2025-07-08T23:00:00.000Z,2025-07-09T01:00:00.000Z,Education & Research,0,"​Genome editing tools allow the introduction of precise changes in the DNA. For this ability, they became indispensable for basic biological research and hold great promise for future therapeutic applications. The same technologies are being utilized also in early human embryos for better understanding of key developmental regulators and DNA repair mechanisms. In the future, precise correction of specific genes might enable curing devastating diseases early in the development or decreasing the risks of certain diseases. Although continuous research is needed before such an intervention becomes safe, the first gene-edited babies were already born. This talk aims to contribute to the debate about human germline gene editing by putting it into a broader context of human biology, discussing the benefits, current limitations, and possible future alternatives leading to the prevention of genetic diseases.

Stepan Jerabek is a postdoctoral research scientist in the Pediatrics Department at Columbia University. He is also an associate scientist at IOCB Prague, an institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Stepan’s interest in early development and genome stability brought him to the Egli laboratory, where he uses genome editing tools to study DNA repair in human preimplantation embryos. In 2024, Stepan was the recipient of the Druckenmiller Fellowship Award from the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute. Stepan completed his doctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Germany and was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, working in the lab of genetics pioneer George Church.

No-code. VibeCoding. In 2025, these terms are trending, promising faster builds, leaner teams, and overnight MVPs. But is the hype holding up? Or are early adopters quietly rewriting entire codebases behind the scenes?

​In this UglyTalk, we crack open the good, the bad, and the downright ugly behind building with low-code and no-code platforms. From shortcuts that became nightmares to smart frameworks that scaled smoothly, this event demystifies what really works and what doesn’t. Straight from the folks in the trenches.

​ 

​🎯 Why You Should Attend

​Whether you’re launching your first product or scaling your second startup, you’ve likely been pitched a “faster” way to build. This is your chance to:

​Avoid the Pain: Hear the cautionary tales before they become your own.

​Steal What Works: Learn from proven wins and hard-earned lessons.

​Get Tactical: Walk away with practical strategies and real tools you can use tomorrow.

​Meet Your People: Founders, CTOs, and ecosystem enablers. All in one room.

​

​🙋 Who You’ll Meet

​Non-technical founders exploring new ways to ship without writing code

​Early-stage startup teams iterating their first or second product

​CTOs and product leaders figuring out what to bet on for scale

​Investors and ecosystem enablers staying ahead of the next wave of builder tech

​Whether you’re building, backing, or bridging tech products. This room is for you.

​🎤 Who’s on the Panel

​Christina Stejskalova - Builder at Ideaslab

​Christina Stejskalova is a data leader with 13+ years of experience and a reputation for turning chaos into clarity. That's the boring bit! From moving to the U.S. being rejected from 200 jobs to landing a job in FANNG and later leading entire functions, I’ve built and rebuilt with grit as my north star. I founded a startup to fight for equality of opportunity, and after its close, I rose fast, becoming a data director younger than most. I’ve transformed two data orgs end to end. Colleagues call me “Data Christina”, but really, I’m just a vibe coder, and grit is my programming language.

​Dileep Mishra - Founder of CyberSE.AI

​Dileep Mishra is a Cybersecurity professional with 20+ years of experience. He has held senior Presales roles at leading technology companies like Akamai, Hughes and Radware. He is now building an AI Security Consulting practice, focused on helping organizations secure their AI deployments.

​The Real Pros & Cons: Where low-code shines and where it breaks

We explore how foundation models are being integrated into real-world products, what tools and techniques are emerging, and what’s next for the field.

AI is no longer just a research discipline—it’s becoming a core part of software development. AI Engineers work at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and product development, making powerful models (like GPT-4, Claude, and open-source alternatives) and in real applications.

​We're thrilled to be joined by Plastic Labs Co-Founder and CEO Vince Trost. He was the first graduate from the Data Science program at Penn State University and has spent his career building AI applications in education, data science infrastructure on Ethereum, and is now building Honcho -- an AI-native memory solution geared towards radically decentralizing alignment.

​Plastic Labs is on a mission to solve personal identity for the agentic world. Generative AI has promised highly bespoke experiences, yet it ends up producing average results for every user. This leads to frustration, limited effectiveness and poor retention. Honcho fixes this by ambiently reasoning about each user and exposing a simple API to query that reasoning and increase their social cognition.

​Description

​How might we relate to a new category of beings: AIs?

​We're all forming dependency and bonds with ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants and companions, yet have no social script for what ‘healthy relationships’ look like with them. Marshall McLuhan observed that ""every extension of man is [also] an amputation"". As these ever-evolving artificial minds extend our cognition and creativity, what parts of our humanity might we be atrophying?

​Maybe you’ve found yourself thinking:

​""I'm not sure where my ideas end and ChatGPT’s begin.”

​“Am I still a creative if AI does half the work?”

​“Is it weird that I use ChatGPT for therapy advice?”

​”I’m curious what would happen if I trained an AI on my voice and thoughts, but that feels really weird.”

​Bring an appetite for the cyborgian as we explore the future of human-AI relationships in a playful, speculative research workshop. We'll dive into present and future instantiations of human-AI interfaces and the relational patterns that may emerge. We’ll also draw on behavioral and cognitive science to understand what's happening in our nervous systems when we blend with artificial minds. We'll explore our own network of AI relationships through embodied exercises, discussion, and collective imagination. You'll leave with new practices and insights for intentional AI collaboration and companionship.

​Learning Outcomes

​Self-awareness of one’s own behavior using personal AI

​Deeper understanding of the complexity, range, and implications of human x AI relationships

​Ability to invite others into inquiry around this topic using new conceptual frames

​Program

​Introduction: Talk on the state of human x AI relationships and emerging societal implications.

​Group Play: Games, discussion, and roleplay around how to show up wisely to these cyborg futures.

​Practice: Draft a plan to bring these insights into your daily life.

​Designed both as a game and a social intervention, this workshop is a way to test in real time, how groups organize, pretend, hide, and move with intention - not as individuals, but as collective entities. This afternoon session, combining lecture, LARP, and strategy, is for anyone who’s made of parts, who’s tired of performing their own identity, and who’s wondered how to exist without becoming content.

​Activities will be facilitated by Nephila, a collective that builds experimental worlding tools, and deployed through their new social OS. Participants will be the first public users to test this tool and will leave the workshop with practical and playful methods for reclaiming agency in the era of slop.

​Learning Outcomes

​Participants will develop skills in online coordination, collective decision-making, and algorithmic deception.

​Participants will enhance their skills in roleplay and group improvisation.

​Participants will learn techniques for understanding, mapping, forecasting chaotic parts of internet culture.

​Syllabus
​
Part 1 - Identity in Sloppy Times

​(Lecture & Discussion)

​What is identity in the age of slop? In this lecture we will scroll through recent AI glitches and internet signals that demonstrate how the way we perform personhood online is changing. How is identity pieced together, deformed, or hallucinated? As we witness convincing AI personas being deployed at scale while human behavior becomes increasingly mimetic of bots, we will try to locate meaningful instances of collective identity formation.

​Part 2 - How to Vanish

​(Micro-LARP)

​An introduction to hiding in plain sight - infiltrate fandoms, craft executables, and satirically game metrics using a new social OS.

​Part 3 - How to Summon

​(Macro-LARP)

​Crash course in collective slop manipulation - seed rumors, avoid shadowbans, coordinate collective actions as financial systems move in real-time.

​Web Applets: software that both humans and AI can understand and use together, Rupert Manfredi, Unternet

​Building great curated news feeds on AT Protocol, Devin Gaffney, Graze

​Ivan Sigal, Free Our Feeds

​Why

​We're on the path to a new kind of web, with an uncertain future: AI-based user agents are now a core interface to the internet for over half-a-billion active users.

​This shift comes as platforms have increasingly seized control of the publisher-reader relationship: search engines are squeezing out web publishers to juice ad revenue, while social platforms have captured audiences with algorithmic reach and paid promotion.

​The rise of new AI super-apps, in place of traditional browsers, is set to make this dynamic exponentially worse.

​How can publishers engage in this platform shift beyond being a dataset to be scraped? How can we avoid being trapped by a new wave of mega-platforms? And how can publishers on the web reach real users, build lasting relationships, and continue to have a equitable business model?

​We believe now is a critical time to get technologists & publishers working together to explore—and define—real answers to these questions.

​One-day forum (invite-only, August 21st)

​Following the evening talks, we're hosting an invite-only forum the following day.

​An invite-only full day of hands-on workshops and focused conversations. We'll rotate through small-group discussions on real-world challenges, witness peer-led demos of protocol integrations, and spend time experimenting with tools. This will be an opportunity to explore real problems and opportunities, and lead to collaborations for future community work.

In June 2025, the U.S. Senate dealt a stunning rebuke to Big Tech’s push for a 10‑year freeze on state AI oversight—voting 99–1 to strip the moratorium from the massive “One Big Beautiful Bill” reconciliation package. This landslide bipartisan vote preserved states’ rights to regulate AI tools related to child safety, deepfakes, data privacy, and more: signaling sharp tension between centralized innovation and decentralized protection. In a fast‑changing world, who should hold the reins on AI?

​What should be our guiding framework when balancing robust AI innovation with the urgent need to regulate harms at the state and local level?

​Three sub‑questions to explore:

​With the Senate rejecting the 10‑year moratorium, how can states lead responsibly, and what happens if federal regulation lags?

​Do state-by-state AI laws risk fragmenting the market and slowing nationwide innovation or are they essential guardrails?

​How do we ensure regulatory models keep pace with AI’s rapid evolution without creating loopholes that Big Tech can exploit?",New York

​Building the Future of Autonomous Intelligence

​September 6, 2025 | Co-hosted with The Residency

​The Inflection Point is Now

​2025 is the year of AI agents. While everyone else is still building wrappers around LLMs, the sharpest builders are crafting the autonomous systems that will define the next decade. Women make up just 22% of AI professionals worldwide and only 12% of AI researchers – but that changes here, today, with us.

​This isn't another hackathon. This is where the future gets built.

​What We're Building

​Real agents. Real autonomy. Real impact.

​We're talking multi-agent systems that reason, plan, and execute without handholding. Supply chain orchestrators. Research companions that think alongside you. Personal AI that actually understands context. The kind of technology that recent winners like RiskWise have proven can tackle complex domains like supply chain risk analysis with AI agents that provide timely, game-changing insights.

​Prize Categories:

​Who Should Be Here

​The Builders:

​Engineers who think in systems, not just code

​Researchers who want their work in production, not just papers

​Founders building the next Anthropic, not the next ChatGPT wrapper

​Women in AI who are tired of being the only one in the room

​The Visionaries:

​Product leaders who understand that agents ≠ chatbots

​Technical founders ready to 10x human capability

​Anyone who believes diverse teams are better at identifying potential biases and blind spots in AI systems

​Why This Matters for Women

​Women's involvement in AI isn't just about technical expertise – it's crucial for ensuring AI solutions tackle ethical and social challenges. Diversity brings unique insights into the ethical and societal implications of AI, helping reduce bias and create technologies that better serve all members of society.

​We're actively building the future we want to see:

​50% of judging panel are women leaders in AI

​Dedicated mentorship track with female AI executives

​Networking designed for meaningful connections, not small talk

​Direct pipeline to female-founded AI companies actively hiring

​Co-hosted with The Residency

​The Residency – where ambitious builders live and work alongside equally driven peers – brings their network of entrepreneurs who've already raised from a16z, Collaborative Fund, and other top-tier investors. With Sam Altman as startup advisor and a track record of supporting high-potential builders, this isn't just an event – it's your entry point into the ecosystem that shapes the future.

Ideal for curious individuals seeking better conversations and new connections.","Mineral Springs, Central Park, W 70th St, New York, NY 10019, USA","New York, New York",Unmuted - Events to Save America,2025-08-09T18:00:00.000Z,2025-08-09T20:00:00.000Z,Networking & Community,0,"​A Free Unmuted Pop-Up | Central Park

​Everyone says America is divided. But what if the real problem isn’t division. It’s self-interest?

​Are we falling apart because too many people are looking out for themselves? Or because we don’t look out for ourselves enough: as cities, as families, as voters, as workers?

​Some say selfishness is destroying the country: corporations hoarding, individuals isolating, no sense of shared sacrifice.
Others say selfishness is exactly what we need: Look out for your own. Be independent. Make the system work for you.

​At this Unmuted pop-up, we’ll gather in Central Park for the big questions, and 360° conversation. You’ll hear sharp takes, test your own views, and meet people who think differently, but are just as curious as you are.

​Come if you’re:

​Tired of both cynicism and naïve idealism

​Craving better conversations than your group chat allows

​A little opinionated and totally open

​Leave with:
A few new friends. And one question you can’t stop thinking about.

​We’ll set the tone. You bring your voice.",New York

Join a thought-provoking happy hour discussion on the complexities of fast fashion, exploring the unintended consequences of abandoning it and the challenges of transitioning to sustainable alternatives. This event delves into the ethical and economic implications of fast fashion's demise on vulnerable workers and economies. Open-minded individuals interested in intelligent conversation are invited to apply and attend.",,"New York, New York",Unmuted - Events to Save America,2025-08-14T22:30:00.000Z,2025-08-15T00:30:00.000Z,Education & Research,0,"​Fast Fashion and Luxury Beliefs: A Harder Look at Who Pays to Be Ethical

​
While fast fashion is often condemned for its environmental and ethical abuses, the call to abandon it outright may reflect a luxury belief: a moral stance affordable only to those who don’t rely on cheap clothing or garment industry jobs. What happens to the 75 million workers, many in vulnerable economies, whose livelihoods depend on fast fashion if it's swiftly dismantled? Who exactly will fund the massive infrastructure shift required to replace fast fashion’s global supply chains with sustainable alternative: governments, brands, or consumers? And finally, if prices rise and access to affordable clothing shrinks, how do we avoid punishing the very people fast fashion once served?

​​It’s more like a break where you kill two birds at once—you get your steps in and meet peers, without wasting time.

​​Why it’s better than a regular meetup

​​Meetups are a hit or miss. And even if it’s bad, you usually stay and end up thinking, I could’ve done more with that time.
With a power walk, even if you don’t vibe with the group, at least you got your steps in.

​Talks

​Philip Kiely @ Baseten - Five things to know about AI infrastructure as you scale

​In 2025, AI-native startups are scaling to 8 figures of annual revenue in months. How do you build infrastructure that keeps up with this explosive growth? This talk provides five sometimes-surprising solutions selected from the hardest challenges we’ve faced while working on scaling fast-growing AI startups.

​Michael N Magan @ Tambo.co - Generative UI in Practice: From Intent to Interface

​Generative UI lets AI assistants surface real UI such as charts, forms, and complete workflows exactly when users need them. This talk shows how it works by treating components as tools: mapping user intent to the right component, binding data, and rendering on the fly. A demo of how we use it internally. I'll close with the main opportunities, and the chief challenges. Attendees leave knowing what generative UI is, why it matters, and how to ship it.

​SallyAnn DeLucia @ Arize - Evaluating Agents in the Wild with Arize

​This talk will demo how Arize supports agent evaluation with a focus on strategy and visibility. I’ll walk through our new Agent View, which aggregates traces, tool use, and reasoning steps into a structured, searchable format—making it easier to debug failures, track performance, and iterate on agent design.

​We’re excited to invite you to a private gathering of senior engineering and technology executives at the Unusual Ventures Thought Leadership Dinner. This exclusive event is designed to catalyze strategic conversations at the intersection of AI, privacy, and data security—where emerging risks meet transformative opportunities.

​You’ll be joining a select group of 16 technology leaders, including:

​John Vrionis, Managing Partner, Unusual Ventures
Niamh O'Donnell, Director of Programs, Unusual Ventures
Abhi Sharma, CEO and Co-Founder, Relyance AI

​Additional guests include top engineering and security minds from leading AI-forward organizations.

​Venue details will be shared directly with registered attendees.

​Topic: The Convergence of Privacy, Data Security, and AI Governance

​As generative and agentic AI systems increasingly influence core business operations, enterprises face a critical challenge: balancing innovation with accountability. The convergence of privacy, data security, and AI governance is no longer a theoretical discussion—it’s a boardroom mandate.

​Next-generation AI architectures require more than technical sophistication; they demand trust, transparency, and resilience. Privacy-preserving machine learning, secure model training, and real-time risk detection are rapidly becoming table stakes. Simultaneously, regulatory expectations around explainability, consent, and data lineage are reshaping how engineering leaders must design and deploy AI systems.

​For Heads of ML, CISOs, and technology executives, this moment calls for intentional leadership:

​How do we build systems that are not only intelligent, but inherently trustworthy?

​How do we future-proof our data and AI pipelines for a fragmented global compliance landscape?

​And how can we embed governance into AI development without slowing down innovation?

​This executive roundtable will unpack these strategic imperatives:

​What architectural principles drive AI systems that are secure, private by design, and auditable at scale?

​How can companies align AI governance with data strategy to create sustainable competitive advantage?

​What best practices are emerging across high-stakes industries—and what lessons can we learn from early adopters?

​Join us for a candid, high-impact discussion on operationalizing trustworthy AI at scale—where security, privacy, and governance are not afterthoughts, but foundational design pillars.",San Francisco

​​If you’ve already tried Codex, you know it’s powerful - but turning it into a reliable developer sidekick requires significant effort. You’ll need to manage sessions, handle long-running tasks, secure sandbox and terminal access, integrate with third-party services like GitHub and deal with A2A to allow multi-agents deployments so you can build a team of coding agents.

​​This workshop is for developers and AI agent builders who want to run open-source coding agents in the cloud, as part of a team, with the right infrastructure behind them.

​​We’ll walk through how to take local coding agents and run them with a proper backend: secure runtimes, persistent memory, triggers via MCP right from your IDE, and multi-agent orchestration using A2A (Agent-to-Agent). No more running brittle scripts on your laptop. No more glue code. Just real infrastructure, ready to scale your agents from toy to teammate.

​​We’ll use xpander.ai, backend-as-a-service for agents, to set up, deploy, and orchestrate coding agents that can interact, share state, and get real work done even when you're offline. We’ll use AgentOps for observability, to monitor, debug, and understand our AI agents' behavior with time-travel session replays, prompt-level insights, and detailed traces of tool calls, errors, and token usage.

​​In under three hours, you’ll go from zero to running agent workflows that are cloud-deployed, event-triggered, and fully observable.

That’s exactly what we’ve been exploring in our Open Labs.

​Last week, we ran a small experiment—using a camera and AI to capture motion data—then ran some very preliminary analysis, pose by pose. You can check out the results in this blog post:

​👉 Semantic Interpretation of Dance Sequences (Part 1)

​It visualizes how a movement sequence maps into a simple two-dimensional semantic space.

​This Wednesday, we’ll design a few new experiments and collect more data to better understand the meaning encoded in movement. Instead of analyzing individual poses, we’ll look at 0.5-second chunks to see if short motion phrases carry more useful information.

​You may ask, why do this? One reason is to explore how a system could observe a dance, learn its patterns, and eventually predict what comes next—just like we do when we watch someone move.

​Meanwhile, we’ll keep rolling (literally) with our contact improvisation with tennis balls as a third partner. Think movement, play, and maybe a bit of massage, too.

​Come move, explore, and play with us!

Festa AI: Stress-Free Wedding Guest Communication,https://lu.ma/9enicspg,"Festa AI streamlines wedding guest communication, eliminating the stress of managing RSVPs, answering repetitive questions, and sending updates.  This AI-powered assistant uses text messaging for easy guest interaction, providing real-time insights and automated responses, leaving couples free to enjoy their wedding planning. Ideal for engaged couples seeking a stress-free wedding experience.","South Park, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA",Not yet specified,,2025-07-07T01:00:00.000Z,2025-07-07T03:00:00.000Z,Tech & AI,0,"​Note: This is not a real event!

​Planning a wedding? Congrats! Also—sorry. Because now you’ve entered the part where 37 people text you “What time does the ceremony start again?” and Aunt Linda demands parking details in writing. 😅

​Enter Festa AI: your new digital wedding assistant that handles all the guest chaos so you don’t have to. Guests get a dedicated number they can text with questions. They’ll get instant answers (like magic), and you won’t have to copy-paste the same info 20 times.

​💬 Text-in Q&A: Guests can ask anything. Festa answers instantly so your phone doesn’t melt down.

​📢 Text blasts: Need to send an update about a venue change or rain plan? One text reaches everyone.

​📋 RSVP tracking: Festa helps you manage RSVPs in real time—no spreadsheets, no stress.

​🎁 Registry support: More eyeballs on your registry = more gifts and honeymoon fund love. Festa makes it easy to share and remind.

​📊 Guest insights: Wondering how many guests have asked about the shuttle? Festa shows you trends and tracks engagement so you’re never out of the loop.

​🧠 Host dashboard: You can check in anytime to see what guests are asking, who’s replied, and what’s still left to do. It’s like having a wedding co-pilot.

​No app to download. No new logins for guests. Just one text thread that works harder than your group chat ever could.

​Whether your vibe is backyard BBQ or black-tie vineyard soirée, Festa helps make sure your guests are informed, your wedding party is on the same page, and you’re not answering the same question 15 times while trying to enjoy your engagement.

​Fewer fires to put out. More champagne to drink. Let Festa handle the noise—so you can focus on the party.

Hear insights from speakers representing Nutanix and PingCAP as they discuss the latest advancements in building and deploying scalable GenAI solutions.

Agenda

​​​5:30 - 6:00 pm: Check-in/networking (food & drinks)

​6:00 - 6:30 pm: Talk #1 - Lessons learned from managing GPU deployments on Kubernetes

​​7:00 - 7:30: Talk #3 - Setting the BAR: Balancing Budget, Authenticity & Reasoning in GenAI

​7:30 - 8:00: Wrap-up/networking

​Talk #1: Lessons learned from managing GPU deployments on Kubernetes

​Speakers: Sonali Mishra & Shalin Patel (Nutanix)
Abstract: Handling workloads that require GPU on Kubernetes has become easier with tools like NVIDIA’s GPU Operator but deploying them in production across real-world environments brings hidden challenges. In this session, we will share lessons learned from managing GPU across different infrastructures including on-prem and across public clouds, air-gapped environments, and different Operating Systems. We will cover compatibility issues with drivers and runtimes, discovering GPU attached nodes and scheduling GPU workloads on Kubernetes clusters. We will also discuss our experience working with vGPUs, the challenges of enabling multi-tenancy, dynamic resource allocation and monitoring. And lastly, we will talk about how we addressed some of these challenges using the NVIDIA GPU operator and our Kubernetes operator for vGPU tokens and license management. This talk is ideal for platform engineers and architects bringing AI/ML to Kubernetes, and looking to scale GPU use efficiently, securely and with better observability.


​Talk #2 - Ship a Lightning-Fast FAQ & Stop Keyword Fails

Speaker: Chris Dabatos (PingCAP)
Abstract: In this session, learn how anyone can build & ship a lightning-fast FAQ with TiDB's built-in vector search with AWS Bedrock and a few plain English Python scripts. There's no need for developers to deal with microservices or cluster baby sitting, and since TiDB is MySQL compatible, your existing ""ORM"" will just work.

​Talk #3 - Setting the BAR: Balancing Budget, Authenticity & Reasoning in GenAI


​Speaker: Jinan Zhou (Nutanix)
Abstract: There is no perfect GenAI cocktail—every system has to mix Budget, Authenticity, and Reasoning. Raise the BAR on two, and you’ll have to water down the third.

​In this session, we’ll introduce the BAR Triangle, a framework for understanding why it’s impossible to fully optimize every dimension of a GenAI system at once. Through practical examples and case studies, you’ll learn how to map your own system onto the triangle, identify the hidden costs of maximizing certain aspects, and develop strategies for choosing the right BAR for your product. Whether you’re building enterprise AI, consumer chatbots, or mission-critical GenAI, this talk will help you make smarter, more transparent tradeoffs—and “set the BAR” that matters most for your goals.",San Francisco

​​📖 Presentation Details

​💡 Meet You in the Middle: 1000× Performance for Parquet Queries on PB-Scale Data Lakes

​Storing data as Parquet files on S3 is increasingly used not just as a data lake but also as a lightweight feature store for ML training/inference or a document store for RAG. However, querying petabyte- to exabyte-scale data lakes directly from cloud object storage remains notoriously slow (e.g., latencies ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to several seconds on AWS S3).

​In this talk, we show how architecture co-design, system-level optimizations, and workload-aware engineering can deliver over 1000× performance improvements for these workloads—without changing file formats, rewriting data paths, or provisioning expensive hardware.

​We introduce a high-performance, low-latency S3 proxy layer powered by Alluxio, deployed atop hyperscale data lakes. This proxy delivers sub-millisecond Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB)—on par with Amazon S3 Express—while preserving compatibility with standard S3 APIs. In real-world benchmarks, a 50-node Alluxio cluster sustains over 1 million S3 queries per second, offering 50× the throughput of S3 Express for a single account, with no compromise in latency.

​Beyond accelerating access to Parquet files byte-to-byte, we also offload partial Parquet processing from query engines via a pluggable interface into Alluxio. This eliminates the need for costly index scans and file parsing, enabling point queries with 0.3 microseconds latency and up to 3,000 QPS per instance (measured using a single-thread)—a 100× improvement over traditional query paths.

​💡 Introduction to Apache Iceberg™ & Tableflow

​The data lake is a fantastic, low-cost place to put data at rest for offline analytics, but we've built it under the terms of a terrible bargain: all that cheap storage at scale was a great thing, but we gave up schema management and transactions along the way. Apache Iceberg has emerged as king of the Open Table Formats to fix this very problem.

​Built on the foundation of Parquet files, Iceberg adds a simple yet flexible metadata layer and integration with standard data catalogs to provide robust schema support and ACID transactions to the once ungoverned data lake. In this talk, we'll build Iceberg up from the basics, see how the read and write path work, and explore how it supports streaming data sources like Apache Kafka™. Then we'll see how Confluent's Tableflow brings Kafka together with open table formats like Iceberg and Delta Lake to make operational data in Kafka topics instantly visible to the data lake without the usual ETL—unifying the operational/analytical divide that has been with us for decades.

​💡 Optimizing Tiered Storage for Low-Latency Real-Time Analytics at AI Scale

​Real-time OLAP databases are optimized for speed and often rely on tightly coupled storage-compute architectures using disks or SSDs. Decoupled architectures, which use cloud object storage, introduce an unavoidable tradeoff: cost efficiency at the expense of performance. This makes them unsuitable for databases that need to provide low-latency, real-time analytics, especially the new wave of LLM-powered dashboards, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and vector-embedding searches that thrive only when fresh data is milliseconds away. Can we achieve both cost efficiency and performance?

​In this talk, we’ll explore the engineering challenges of extending Apache Pinot—a real-time OLAP system—onto cloud object storage while still maintaining sub-second P99 latencies.

​We’ll dive into how we built an abstraction in Apache Pinot to make it agnostic to the location of data. We’ll explain how we can query data directly from the cloud (without needing to download the entire dataset, as with lazy-loading) while achieving sub-second latencies. We’ll cover the data fetch and optimization strategies we implemented, such as pipelining fetch and compute, prefetching, selective block fetches, index pinning, and more. We'll also share our latest work about integration with open table formats like iceberg, and how we will continue to achieve fast analytics directly on parquet files by implementing all the same techniques that apply to tiered storage.",San Francisco

We also have some exclusive and priority access and rewards planned for those who RSVP-ed early. - Varun

​A backstory on why we at Hyperspace have been building it:

​the idea of an agentic browser pokes at the idea of how do the agents rank and utilize each other in order to best serve users. we believe this compounds user utility over time. Search engines have built-in network effects: more people use the web, the smarter they (ought to) become with more credible websites “voting” for webpages in an uber-democratic real-time process. this compounds and compresses society’s knowledge.

​is it true with single-shot AI answer engines which are wrapping search results ? you ask a question, get generated answer and move on - how does that feedback into making the underlying system a lot smarter over time ? what has it learnt about that page compared to other pages which fundamentally improves the experience for the Nth user ?

​for example - consider the “rental car” problem. 

​1) enter that term in a search engine like Google, what do you get ? list of top car rental websites

​2) enter it in an answer engine, what do you get ? you get English-ized version of (1) above. great, now you know the names of the biggest rental car companies in the US. as a user, you are basically back at (1) above. 

​what did you as a user really want ? you wanted the best rental car options for you and also things happening leading to a booking: based on your needs and preferences. so right answer for you would have been a series of actions:

​- a question: which city do you need this in and approximately when ? what kind of cars do you like to drive ? 

​- found you these Tesla Model 3 rentals, available on these dates for this price, and booking available on these few websites and apps, 

​- and i will re-run this analysis every 30 mts for next 2 weeks until your travel to see if can find you a better price and negotiate behind the scenes 

​this, is the next society productivity unlock as this is the flow the user would have been the MOST happiest with. that is the 5 star user experience. and that’s only going to happen in the most seamless way in a software system custom-designed for this purpose, an agentic browser, which leverages AI agents (nameless processes recursively spanning and orchestrating themselves using all types of infrastructure necessary in order to satisfy the user need). 

​where a search engine and an answer engine “gives up” after showing rudimentary options, the agentic browser is a relentless beast of a machine which keeps on running and processing, and orchestrating many agents together into getting the job done for the user. during this time, it is learning and compounding on the nature of agents and their interactions themselves’. it is not just a standalone software, but a network, and it requires a different DNA altogether. 

​this is the world we are building, and it spans many components: from a revolutionary new user interface, to insanely powerful on-device capabilities, to plugging into the world’s largest distributed data and compute cluster, and using the right decentralized protocols for agent-to-agent transactions and payments to build trust in the system. 

​this is going to be the largest new economy built from scratch this decade.",San Francisco

​This interactive workshop — combining presentation, Q&A, and live experimentation — will provide you clarity on what LLM orchestration is precisely about, and how to recognize early, promising patterns for your investment portfolio.

​We'll also explore related topics, including the strategic rationale behind OpenAI’s acquisition interest in Windsurf, reasons computer-generated intelligence continues accelerating despite slower progress in base LLM performance, and many more.

​This workshop requires no technical background, only a good intuition about the AI tech startup ecosystem.

RSVP now for a chance to win and network!","Sentry, 45 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA",Not yet specified,SF Bay Area Ruby Meetup,2025-07-19T17:00:00.000Z,2025-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,Hackathon,0,"​We are thrilled to announce a community-driven Ruby AI Hackathon on Saturday, July 19, 2025 at the Sentry office in San Francisco! 🎉 Hosted by the SF Bay Area Ruby Meetup, this one-day hackathon is open to Ruby engineers of all kinds from the SF area. Details:

​When: Saturday, July 19, 2025, 10:00 am to 5:30 pm

​Where: Sentry HQ – 45 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA

​Host: SF Bay Area Ruby Meetup

​Who: Open to all Rubyists & friends in the Bay Area at any experience level

​Teams: Solo or teams up to 3 people – your choice

​Entry fee: None!

​Food: lunch brought to you by Sentry

​Prizes: $1,500 for the best team; $1,000 for the 2nd best team; $500 for the third best team

​Rails as the one-person framework

​AI-assisted coding has exploded onto the scene, promising to amplify what solo devs can do. Ruby on Rails is the perfect partner for this approach. Rails has long been known as the one-person framework, a powerful toolkit designed to give lone developers and small teams superpowers, compressing the time and knowledge needed to ship big features

​This Ruby AI hackathon is about exploring that vision: how AI can make building a Rails app even more of a one-person show! Some participants might even experiment with voice coding setups – it’s all about exploring new ways to build with Ruby.

​Current plans

​You can work solo as part of a small team. Bring your own application idea to life or choose from several project prompts we’ll provide if you need inspiration. Throughout the day, mentors will be on hand to help with technical issues, brainstorm AI solutions, or just cheer you on. We’re working on bringing special guests from the Ruby AI community joining as mentors and judges.

​As an all-day event, we’ll have breaks for lunch and snacks. At the end of the day, each individual or team will get to demo their app and briefly show off their code. A panel of judges will evaluate each project and provide encouraging feedback. They’ll be looking at creativity, use of the theme, and technical achievement given the time constraints.

​Ready to hack? RSVP now!

​Sounds exciting? We sure hope so! RSVP on our Meetup page here so we can get a headcount. If you have any questions, feel free to drop by our Ruby SF Slack channel. Otherwise, just bring your laptop on July 19 and get ready to code with vibes.

What’s the one quadrant of intelligence we forgot to teach our machines?

​In a world where artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, we often focus so much on the tools that we forget to ask:
What kind of world are we shaping in return?

​

​🎤 About the Speaker

​De Kai invented the technology that led to Google Translate, Yahoo Translate, and Bing—but his work goes far beyond engineering. His work spans decades at the intersection of AI, culture, ethics, and collective consciousness. As a Founding Fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics and former member of Google’s AI ethics council, De Kai is one of the few voices asking:

​Should we be afraid? Or should we take responsibility?

​In his book Raising AI, he reframes AI not as tools or threats—but as children. Impressionable, powerful, and growing fast. It’s not just about what we build, but how we raise them.

​

​🧭 What We’ll Explore

​How the automation of thought is quietly reshaping our lives

​Why culture, not just code, is the real battleground

​What it means to be the responsible adults in the room

​Let’s come together to explore and fill in The Missing Quadrant—together.

​​​​Help us say, ""Close OpenAI!"" OpenAI is the company leading the race to smarter-than-human AI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), i.e., an AI that is smarter than all human experts across all technical domains. 2,700 cited AI researchers said in a poll that there is a 19% chance of AGI causing human extinction, and Geoffrey Hinton, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in AI in 2024, says there is a 50% chance of AGI causing human extinction. Some experts, like Dr. Roman Yampolskiy, say the risk of extinction is 99.99%. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, when asked about the worst case for AGI, said it could be, ""lights out for all of us."" Sam Altman has also said AGI will arrive in 2025. It is impossible to have experimental evidence that the behavior of an AGI will stay safe indefinitely and that AGI will never want something that will lead to our extinction similar to how we as Homo Sapiens often caused the extinction of many less intelligent species.

​Join us at Madrone Art Bar for a talk with cognitive neuroscientist and AI researcher Roshni, whose work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and machine ethics.

​As artificial intelligence grows more powerful—and more human-like—we’re faced with an urgent question: how do we stop it from replicating the worst parts of ourselves? In this talk, Roshni explores what happens when machines mimic minds that are manipulative, narcissistic, or even psychopathic. Using the “Dark Triad” of human personality as a cautionary framework, she’ll take us inside the science of empathy—how it works in the brain, how it breaks down in antisocial individuals, and why it matters for the future of AI.

​Drawing on cutting-edge research in moral psychology, neuroimaging, and large language models, this talk offers a new lens on emotional intelligence—not just in humans, but in machines. From the alignment problem to the ethics of artificial personalities, we’ll explore what it takes to build AI that doesn’t just think—but cares. 🧠💻

Ideal for aspiring founders and those seeking resourceful growth solutions.","San Francisco, CA, USA","San Francisco, California",Ontology of Value®,2025-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,2025-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,Startup & Entrepreneurship,0,"​​Bootstrapping as a founder feels like hosting a dinner party with whatever’s left in the fridge. You’ve got half a carrot, a block of slightly suspicious cheese, and a dash of optimism—but somehow, you whip up a feast. It’s a never-ending festival of creativity and thriftiness, where “fundraising” means selling an old guitar on eBay, and “marketing” means personally DMing strangers on LinkedIn at 2 a.m.

​​Bootstrapping isn’t just a funding strategy—it’s a mindset. It’s saying, “I’ll figure it out” when the odds are stacked and the bank account is laughing at you. It’s turning constraints into superpowers and setbacks into punchlines you’ll one day share on a TED stage. 

​​Because the truth is, when you’re bootstrapping, every little win feels like striking gold. And that’s the magic: making something extraordinary with nothing but grit, gumption, and a touch of caffeine-fueled genius.

​​Why Are We Organizing This Event?

​​This evening event is dedicated to empowering tech entrepreneurs with actionable strategies to successfully bootstrap their ventures in uncertain times.

​​Amidst an ongoing crisis in tech, we face unique challenges: reduced funding opportunities, heightened competition, and shifting market demands. Yet, adversity often drives creativity. Can you count? Then count on yourself and uncover a whole world of possibilities for how to generate revenue with little to no funding.

​​Through engaging talks, expert panel, and networking sessions, we’ll explore how to:

​​Build sustainable business models from the ground up.

​​Leverage alternative funding and growth strategies.

​​Maximize revenue with limited resources.

​​Tap into community support and collaborative ecosystems.

​​Whether you’re launching a startup or scaling an idea on a shoestring budget, this event will provide you inspiration to turn challenges into opportunities.

​​Join us to connect with like-minded entrepreneurs and industry experts, and discover how resilience and resourcefulness can lead to success in the tech world!

Ideal for startup founders, consultants, and anyone needing to improve communication with potential collaborators or clients.",,"Stanford, California",Bay Area Founders Club,2025-07-12T22:00:00.000Z,2025-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,Career & Skills,0,"​Hi, I’m Alec Walker (Founder & Co-President at Stanford Angels & Entrepreneurs Texas Chapter). I help run executive education sessions at Stanford’s d.school and at Google, and I help run a part of the Stanford Alumni Association focused on matching startups with angel investors. I’ve started and sold a couple of data science startups, and I’ve helped execute AI projects at companies like Dow, Intel, GM, and Chevron, among others.

​Instructor Video – Learn how this session turns ideas into action and builds a real tool you’ll actually use.

​These days, cold outreach is broken. Inboxes are flooded. People ignore messages—even good ones—because they feel templated, irrelevant, or inauthentic. What works now isn’t volume; it’s resonance. The best outreach feels warm—even if it’s your first message—because it’s tailored, thoughtful, and clearly comes from someone who gets it.

​That kind of outreach starts before you ever hit “send.” It begins with building a brand people can’t ignore. When you’ve got a clear message, a distinct tone, and a reason people should trust you, your emails don’t feel like cold calls. They feel like welcome introductions.

​Once you’ve built that brand, you can assemble a contact list that actually wants to hear from you—not just a spreadsheet of names, but a community of potential collaborators, customers, mentors, or investors who are more likely to open, engage, and respond.

​This workshop will show you how to do all of that—and how to automate it, responsibly. We’ll build a tool that uses AI to take your message, understand your tone, research your contacts, and generate bespoke emails that match what each individual recipient actually cares about.

​If you’re excited to learn how to use AI to actually do something for you—not just chat—I hope you’ll join my upcoming hands-on virtual workshop, where you’ll build your own AI-powered outreach tool using Google Suite and custom scripts. Heads up that you’ll also need to create an openrouter API which will cost you $5. Instead of sending generic content to everyone with classic “mail merge,” you’ll be able to craft one message and oversee AI as it customizes the content you’ll send out to each individual recipient. Sound helpful? Let’s build it together.

​This workshop is for you if:

​You’ve felt stuck reaching out to people—even when you know they should be interested.

​You’re sitting on a contact list you’ve never really activated.

​You’re curious about how AI can not just help write, but actually research and personalize at scale.

​You’re a great fit if:

​You want to connect more effectively with collaborators, investors, potential customers, or mentors.

​You like the idea of AI helping you write—but you want it to do more than spit out bland templates.

​You want to teach AI your tone, not just rely on generic prompts.

​You’d rather build something useful today than just talk about what’s possible.

​You might be:

​A startup founder gearing up to fundraise or sell

​A solo consultant trying to grow your pipeline

​A nonprofit leader looking to activate your network

​A curious technologist or creative excited about real-world automation

​In this interactive session, expect:

​Real tools, real use cases. You’ll set up a working script that connects to Google Sheets, learns your voice, researches contacts, and sends smart, personal emails.

​Live scripting and debugging. You’ll see behind the curtain. No black boxes—just transparent, vibe-coded AI magic using Google Apps Script and prompt engineering best practices.

​Beginner-friendly pace. No coding experience needed. If you’ve ever used Google Sheets and written an email, you’re good to go.

​A bit of laughter and experimentation. We’ll have fun, get creative, and learn to trust a process that feels more like collaborating with a smart assistant than filling out a rigid form.

​By the end, you’ll be able to:

​Identify and assemble a quality contact list

​Train AI to write in your voice

​Automatically research contacts and tailor messaging accordingly

​Generate and send custom outreach at scale, with subject lines that actually get clicks

​Receive a certificate upon completion of this workshop

​This isn’t just an email tool. It’s a confidence builder and a relationship accelerator.
If you’ve got a message worth spreading, we’ll help you make sure it lands.

Drawing on a large-scale study conducted around the 2020 U.S. presidential election, this talk explores how political alignment often outweighs truth in determining what we believe and share.

​We’ll unpack why even highly educated or analytically minded individuals fall prey to bias, why people tend to resist true stories that challenge their beliefs more than they embrace false ones that confirm them—and what it all means for democracy, media, and our collective sense of reality. 🧠📣

​Join us at Wave Collective for a conversation with Stanford professor and molecular biologist Dr. Christopher Barnes as we zoom in—way in—on the microscopic battles happening between viruses and our immune system.

​Using cutting-edge imaging tools, scientists can now see viruses down to the atomic level, revealing how they invade our cells and how our bodies fight back. In this talk, we’ll explore how that knowledge is helping researchers design therapies that don’t just treat infection—but prevent it entirely.

​From COVID-19 to the next unknown threat, we’ll decode the molecular language of viruses, uncover how our bodies learn to defend against them, and explore why this science is key to building smarter, faster pandemic responses. 🧪🌍

​Join us in San Francisco on Sunday, July 27th (2 – 8 pm PT) for an afternoon of working with Manus AI.

​As examples, you and your team will use Manus to:

​​Kickstart a product using open-source code
Watch Demo ▶️

​​Identify potential customers
Watch Demo ▶️

​​Optimize your website for SEO
Watch Demo ▶️

​​After work, there will be presentations of the work accomplished and prizes for the best demos.

​We’ll close with a networking hour to continue conversations and deepen connections within and across verticals.

​​​What is Manus?

​​​Manus is the world’s first general AI agent designed to turn your thoughts into action. More than just a chatbot, Manus autonomously executes complex tasks across your professional and personal life - whether it’s conducting deep market research, processing batches of files, planning custom travel, or analyzing data.

​​​It thinks independently, plans strategically, and leverages tools within its own environment—coding, browsing the web, controlling applications—to deliver complete outcomes, not just recommendations.

​​​You can hand off tasks to Manus, track progress in real time, and return to find the results ready—so you can focus on what truly matters.

​​​Why Manus?

​​​The name “Manus” is inspired by MIT’s motto Mens et Manus—“Mind and Hand.” It reflects the belief that knowledge must be applied to create real-world impact.

​​​That’s the promise of Manus AI: to extend your capabilities, amplify your output, and serve as the intelligent hand that brings your ideas to life.",San Francisco

​With so many of our closest people coming together for this special weekend, we wanted to create something meaningful and memorable beyond just the wedding celebration.

​So, on July 5th from 10 AM to 6 PM, we’re hosting a “Life Unconference” at Berlinhouse / Frontier Tower on Market Street — and you’re warmly invited.

​Weddings are a beautiful ritual — a chance to gather in support of two people beginning a new chapter. But they’re also a rare moment when we have brilliant minds, big hearts, and trusted friends in one place. So let’s make space for the deeper conversations:

​💍 What does it mean to build a marriage that lasts?

​👶 How do we raise children with love, purpose, and resilience?

​💪 How do we stay healthy and joyful as we grow older together?

​🙏 How can we live with more presence, gratitude, and intention — as individuals and as partners?

​This won’t be a formal conference — think of it more like an open circle, a co-created gathering. We’ll share stories, mindsets, reflections, and frameworks that have helped us navigate life’s biggest questions. No hierarchy, no panels — just wisdom, humor, and heart.

​If you’ve ever had a thought like “I wish I had a room full of trusted people to talk about the real stuff,” this is that room.

​If you want to give talks, please fill out this form here - you can give talks about anything, we encourage you to talk about something you are passionate about.

​We’d love for you to join us — whether you want to listen, share, ask, or just be present.

""Imagination without reason is mere fancy, but reason without imagination is sterile. That is partly why scientists and philosophers alike have always used imaginary scenarios to help sharpen their ideas and push them to their limits."" - The Pig that Wants to be Eaten, by Julian Baggini

For this meeting (July 2), we'll be discussing the ethics of procreation and the non-identity problem:

​We'll take some time to review this primer on this issue: https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2014/02/27/non-identity-problem/

​It is recommended to also read this short article beforehand: https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil308/Parfit1.pdf

​Some examples of things we've discussed at past meetings:

​Could a vegetarian eat a pig with a clear conscience, if that pig wanted to be eaten?

​Does a person survive using a teleporter that destroys the body and recreates it with perfect fidelity?

​Does the existence of evil in the world pose a problem for belief in a benevolent God?

​We'll be meeting in the 550 Room (down the stairs on the North side). Contact me by text if you're having trouble finding the location.

Designed for beginners and innovators alike, this class demystifies how emulsions, micelles, and active ingredients interact with the skin—empowering you to create your own personalized moisturizer with function and longevity in mind.

​You’ll learn how emulsions—mixtures of immiscible liquids such as oil and water—form the structural basis of most skincare formulations. Specifically, we’ll work with oil-in-water emulsions, where fine droplets of oil are dispersed within a continuous water phase. These are stabilized by micelles, spherical aggregates of surfactant molecules that encapsulate oil droplets, preventing them from separating. Micelles not only enable emulsification but also serve as nanocarriers that can cleanse the skin, maintain hydration, and deliver bioactive compounds efficiently.

​We’ll explore the role of active ingredients such as vitamin C, a potent antioxidant that supports collagen synthesis and neutralizes oxidative stress, and zinc oxide, a mineral UV filter that provides broad-spectrum protection against DNA-damaging solar radiation. These ingredients are foundational in the formulation of skincare designed to support cellular longevity, photoprotection, and barrier repair.

​This session blends the spirit of DIY innovation with cutting-edge dermatological science. Participants will leave with a custom-formulated hand moisturizer and a foundational understanding of how topical formulations can be engineered to support long-term skin health.",San Francisco

Grunwald will highlight innovative solutions and the critical role of policy and technology in addressing this challenge. This event is ideal for climate activists, food system experts, and anyone concerned about the planet's future.","9Zero Climate Innovation Hub, 350 California St 4th floor, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA","San Francisco, California",9Zero Climate Innovation Hub - San Francisco,2025-07-17T19:30:00.000Z,2025-07-17T20:30:00.000Z,Networking & Community,0,"​Bring your lunch and join climate journalist and author Mike Grunwald at 9Zero SF for a discussion and celebration of the launch of his new book, ""We Are Eating the Earth,"" available on July 1!

​About the book:

​From the author of New York Times bestseller The New New Deal, a groundbreaking piece of reportage from the trenches of the next climate war: the fight to fix our food system.

Humanity has cleared a land mass the size of Asia plus Europe to grow food, and our food system generates a third of our carbon emissions. By 2050, we’re going to need a lot more calories to fill nearly 10 billion bellies, but we can’t feed the world without frying it if we keep tearing down an acre of rainforest every six seconds. We are eating the earth, and the greatest challenge facing our species will be to slow our relentless expansion of farmland into nature. Even if we quit fossil fuels, we’ll keep hurtling towards climate chaos if we don’t solve our food and land problems.

In this rollicking, shocking narrative, Grunwald shows how the world, after decades of ignoring the climate problem at the center of our plates, has pivoted to making it worse, embracing solutions that sound sustainable but could make it even harder to grow more food with less land. But he also tells the stories of the dynamic scientists and entrepreneurs pursuing real solutions, from a jungle-tough miracle crop called pongamia to genetically-edited cattle embryos, from Impossible Whoppers to a non-polluting pesticide that uses the technology behind the COVID vaccines to constipate beetles to death. It’s an often infuriating saga of lobbyists, politicians, and even the scientific establishment making terrible choices for humanity, but it’s also a hopeful account of the people figuring out what needs to be done—and trying to do it.

Michael Grunwald, bestselling author of The Swamp and The New New Deal, builds his narrative around a brilliant, relentless, unforgettable food and land expert named Tim Searchinger. He chronicles Searchinger’s uphill battles against bad science and bad politics, both driven by the overwhelming influence of agricultural interests. And he illuminates a path that could save our planetary home for ourselves and future generations—through better policy, technology, and behavior, as well as a new land ethic recognizing that every acre matters.

​​Chef Lemuel Ramos brings a dynamic, ingredient-driven approach to California cuisine, celebrating our rich agricultural bounty through modern technique and thoughtful storytelling.

​​His menus are shaped by the seasons, guided by what’s freshest from local farmers and purveyors, ensuring each dish tells a story.

​​A Bay Area native, Lemuel’s culinary perspective is shaped by his experiences in some of the city’s most acclaimed kitchens—drawing from his time at one-Michelin star Nari, one-Michelin star Mister Jiu’s, and James Beard Award-winning Bar Agricole.

​​Inspired by his fine-dining experience and drawing from his own heritage of Chinese and Southeast Asian influences, his cooking reimagines familiar flavors in unexpected ways.

Join us as we embrace the full warmth of the Season on Flourishing and learn to harness our own sources of renewal.

​​On the first Sundays of every month, gather for an evening of guided journaling and sharing alongside your neighbors in Hayes Valley. This gathering is a space to slow down, honor your experiences of the past month, and connect with others in the neighborhood.

​​You'll honor your personal experiences of the past month with a series of reflections, inspired by the life of the monarchs:

​​Flourishing: What was a moment you felt closest to flourishing?

​​Encounter: What was a moment you encountered the limits of your human existence? (.e.g. loss, choice, suffering?)

​​Origins: What was a moment you felt, ""This is what makes me who I am""?

​​Becoming: What was a moment you felt, ""This is who I want to be?""

​​If you're in a social vibe, joining as a Mingling Muser will allow you to share reflections with a small group.

​​If you want to journal alone, joining as a Solo Sojourner will give you space alongside quiet company for a private reflection.

​​Come with something to write with/on. If you've come before, bring your pebble. ​Invite a friend!

​​""A lovely way to spend a Sunday evening -- the jam gave me the chance to slow down and sit with the triumphs, disappointments, and transitions of a chaotic and difficult month.” —Justin

​​“It was a great way to reflect on my month and what I'd learned from my experiences, while meeting some new people and discussing deeper topics.” —Trevor

​You will learn

​""the two axioms (δ-flip & “observer = observed”) in ten minutes;""

​""why curvature is just an unpaired even loop (and why that quantises gravity);""

​""how the 1⁄4 black-hole entropy factor emerges from hex-voxel combinatorics;""

​""why a single global odd tick on the particle horizon nails the observed Λ;""

​​​​​​The speed of this latent unlock creates a reality distortion field, a narrative violation.

​​​​​​It's not just improbable, it seems impossible.

​​​​​​The premise is first questioned, then fought, and then shaken.

​​​​​​But then a small group of people finds your work - and it's what they've been looking for their whole life.

​​​​​​They fought and clawed for an answer despite the experts' heeding that it wasn't possible.

​​​​​​And then they met you. Your research redefines what's possible.

​​​What is Manus?

​​​Manus is the world’s first general AI agent designed to turn your thoughts into action. More than just a chatbot, Manus autonomously executes complex tasks across your professional and personal life - whether it’s conducting deep market research, processing batches of files, planning custom travel, or analyzing data.

​​​It thinks independently, plans strategically, and leverages tools within its own environment—coding, browsing the web, controlling applications—to deliver complete outcomes, not just recommendations.

​​​You can hand off tasks to Manus, track progress in real time, and return to find the results ready—so you can focus on what truly matters.

​​​Why Manus?

​​​The name “Manus” is inspired by MIT’s motto Mens et Manus—“Mind and Hand.” It reflects the belief that knowledge must be applied to create real-world impact.

​​​That’s the promise of Manus AI: to extend your capabilities, amplify your output, and serve as the intelligent hand that brings your ideas to life.

How is AI reshaping the way we design, engineer, and make decisions at scale?

​As artificial intelligence rapidly weaves itself into the fabric of our industries, it’s not just workflows that are changing - it’s the very foundation of how we think, create, and lead. From investing to infrastructure, from designing user journeys to building distributed systems, AI is prompting a fundamental shift. How do we stay human in the loop while we increasingly build with machines?

​In collaboration with Headway Circuit - India’s first national community for women in investing and tech in their first decade of work - we’re bringing together voices from across design, engineering, venture capital, and product strategy to explore this question.

​This event is more than a panel. It’s an inter-disciplinary conversation and networking evening designed to help us reflect on the future we're building, together.

​Meet our panel

​Poorvi Vijay, Principal at Elevation Capital, is a seasoned investor, with deep insights on how founders are leveraging AI to reshape their industries. An HBS alum, she brings a strategic view of how investment decisions are evolving in the age of AI.

​Charmie Kapoor, Associate Director of Design at Razorpay, has designed for scale at companies like Unacademy, Dunzo, and Microsoft. She’ll offer perspective on how design leadership is evolving in response to intelligent systems and how to champion user needs amidst automation.

​Akanksha Deswal, Head of Engineering (India) at DevRev, has helped build everything from control planes at Nutanix to data systems at Microsoft Azure. At DevRev, she leads engineering on identity and platform infrastructure, and will speak to how engineers are rethinking architecture in an AI-first world.

​This conversation will be moderated by Arushi Jindal, Co-founder of Headway Circuit and Strategy and Operations Lead for India/APAC at DevRev. She was previously an investor across India/US in AI and consumer-tech investing.

​LIFE CENTRIC DESIGN

​Designing not for ""users,"" but for humans.

​This session dives into what it really means to design for real lives: messy, vibrant, unpredictable lives rooted by culture, context, and daily needs, especially in emerging markets. In a world where diversity in environment, infrastructure, and identity is the norm, not the exception, research can’t be shallow and must go deeper. We’re reframing user research not as a checkbox for inclusion, but as a critical engine for resilient, respectful, life-centered design.

​Persist – plug in a checkpointer and make memory stick.

​Rewind & diff – trace an agent’s reasoning, tweak, and replay.

​Branch & merge – test multiple paths, keep the best one.

🔍 What we’ll cover

​Evolution of Learning: why imitation, self‑supervision and reinforcement each matter at different stages of capability building.

​Part I – Autonomous Driving

​See how self‑driving moved from separate modules to one big “camera‑to‑steering” neural network, using bird’s‑eye‑view transformers and attention tricks for perception and control.

​We’ll also cover easy‑to‑grasp reinforcement‑learning tweaks that make cars drive safely in messy real‑world traffic.

​Part II – Humanoids & Whole‑Body Intelligence

​We’ll apply those learning ideas to robots with arms and legs, treating walking, grabbing and navigating as one combined problem.

​You’ll hear how imitation learning plus smart reward rules (like “stay balanced” and “repeat steps”) train robots to move smoothly and work with humans.

​This isn’t about hacks, reels for the sake of reels, or hashtag voodoo.

​This is where serious marketers who are genuinely growing brands on Instagram come together to share what’s working, what’s changed, and what still drives attention, affinity, and action.

​And like every LAN meetup — no fluff, no stage preaching, just real use cases, open conversations, and sharp tactics.

​What’s the Scene?

​📌 Key Topics in Discussion Groups:

​How are you growing your brand on Instagram in 2025?

​What’s actually converting — reels, carousels, memes, or something else?

​Is Instagram still relevant for B2B? If yes, how are you making it work?

​Are you optimizing for followers, engagement, or conversions — and what’s the tradeoff?

​How do you balance trend-chasing vs. brand voice?

​Tools and workflows that are saving time (and sanity)

​What’s not working anymore?

​You’ll also tell us in advance what you want to deep dive into — and we’ll organize the group discussions accordingly.

​First Half

​We’ll break into smaller sub-groups to dissect what it takes to grow a brand on Instagram — consistently, creatively, and strategically.

​This part is:

​🔍 Discussion-heavy
🤝 Peer-led
📊 Strategy-rich

​Second Half

​Show & Tell: Some of you will walk us through your content strategy, post performance, creative workflows, or campaign results (only if you opt in).
Free-flow Networking: Connect with others who obsess over audience building, creators, growth loops, or social storytelling.

​Format

​Real-time breakout discussions

​Peer-led breakdowns and strategy swaps

​No-stage, no-sales networking

​Who is this for?

​You must be a marketer actively working on Instagram brand growth, either:

​In-house at a brand (B2C, D2C, or B2B)

​Or building your own brand or content-led project

​With 2+ years of marketing experience

​This is not for:

​Folks just exploring Instagram without active work

​Paid media-only roles who don’t touch content

​Anyone looking for Insta-101 tips - this is for operators, not observers

​You should be excited to share, dissect, and collaborate.

​Why are we doing this?

​Because growing a brand on Instagram has changed dramatically — and continues to.
And in that chaos, the best answers don’t live in a YouTube tutorial or Twitter thread.

​They live with the people doing it, testing it, and iterating on it - just like you.

​LLMs with a Worldview: When Context is King

​Welcome to Episode 2 of Attention After-Hours by Evam Labs. The last time around, we explored how you can build your own Agents.

​
This time, we explore how they understand—deeply, spatially, and in context.
From real-world signals to real production challenges in image generation, this one’s about building AI that gets it.

​Session 1

​Unlocking Real-World Intelligence: How We Built an LLM-Powered Search Engine That Understands Place

​Speakers: Vishaal, Mithul

​Most LLMs are stuck in the abstract…
But when you plug in real-world signals—mobility flows, satellite imagery, demographics, built environments—you get a model that doesn’t just generate text, it understands place, people, and movement.

​This session is your behind-the-scenes tour of Digital Atlas Search, our AI-native search engine that lets users explore the world by similarity. Search any city or neighborhood, and instantly discover places that feel just like it, based on the patterns that actually matter: how people move, how spaces are built, and who lives there.

​We’ll share how we trained geospatial embeddings using transformers, wired them into a global vector index, and built a responsive frontend that makes discovery intuitive.

​Session 2

​Pushing the limits of Image Generation - Learnings and Best Practices.

​Speakers: Akshit, Anand

​AI image models are getting better every month.
But can they deliver brand-safe, high-quality content at scale?

​Spoiler: not without a lot of trial, error, and GPU pain.

​This session is a no-BS download of what we’ve learned from building image generation pipelines across models and use cases. We’ll share which models actually deliver, when to fine-tune, how to debug hallucinations, and what to do when “high-res” turns into why-res.

​Session 3

​BYOA – Bring Your Own Agents

​Got something cool cooking with agents?
Built a demo that deserves the limelight?

​We're keeping 2 open slots for anyone brave (and brilliant) enough to showcase their AI side project.
