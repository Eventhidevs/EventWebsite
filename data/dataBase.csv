Systems Reading Group with Prime Intellect,https://lu.ma/mgbap0ro,"This Systems Reading Group explores Prime Intellect's TOPLOC paper, a novel method for verifiable inference in Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing trust challenges in AI services.  The session features a deep dive into the paper's highlights, code examples, and Q&A, welcoming both systems experts and enthusiasts. Food and drinks provided.",San Francisco,,Greylock,2025-06-24,07:30 AM,"June 23, 2025",09:00 PM,Tech & AI,0.0,"​Come by for a deep dive into verifiable inference through Prime Intellect's recent TOPLOC paper!

​Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be very capable, but access to frontier models currently relies on inference providers. This introduces trust challenges: how can we be sure that the provider is using the model configuration they claim? TOPLOC is a novel method for verifiable inference that addresses this problem, empowering users to verify LLM inference computations efficiently, laying a foundation for decentralized, verifiable and trustless AI services.

​For this session, we'll get ~30-35 folks of different systems backgrounds together to go through the highlights of the paper, answer key questions, and dive into some implementation code. Come by whether you have a systems background, or are just systems-curious!

​We'll have food and drinks provided as well."

​The RISE UP for Breast Cancer Conference highlighted the urgent need to bring together like-minded, innovative leaders and investors to accelerate meaningful progress in women’s health, something that is now more important than ever. RISE UP was a really stimulating meeting with lots of new ideas about how we can either combine or rethink the types of products that we use for hormonal interventions across a woman’s lifetime for cycle control, birth control, IVF, postpartum weaning, and postmenopausal symptom management to think about how we can reduce the risk of breast cancer. This innovation has the potential to truly drive down the rate of breast cancer, while also addressing other health priorities such as cycle control, contraception, symptom management, IVF, fibroids, postpartum weaning, and symptom management after menopause. A tremendous opportunity exists for women entrepreneurs, investors, and VCs to play a critical leadership role in defining where we go with women’s health research and how it gets supported. The current climate has further deprioritized federal investment in women’s health – so it becomes especially critical to find a way forward.

​Our inaugural meeting of RISE UP for Breast Cancer was in November 2024. Given the tremendous response, we are planning on having it annually! In 2026, our meeting will be February 19-21 (website:  www.riseup.ucsf.edu).

​A lot of interesting ideas came up in preparation for this meeting, and more at the meeting about how we can reframe our thinking and create new interventions that aim to reduce breast cancer incidence. Our final session of the meeting was devoted to a “Shark Tank” session where new ideas that were ready for initial testing were pitched. There were 4 SPARK awards in the final session that received funding with promise to move the field in this direction.  This year, we would also like to see more mature ideas receive implementation awards for pivotal innovations as well as providing “spark funding” for promising early stage new ideas.

​We want to hear your ideas to engage the community of women’s health investors and entrepreneurs to create opportunities to take promising ideas forward, especially those with preliminary data. There is so much important work to do. We look forward to welcoming you at our first Women’s Healthcare Leadership Brunch on June 24th and please RSVP by June 1st.

​ Cheers to moving women’s health forward!"

​Breaking down silos between design, simulation, and analysis — Practical strategies for better team coordination

​Quantifying time savings and ROI — Building compelling business cases that get budget approval

​Join Engineering at the Frontier, where we confront an uncomfortable reality: while engineers design complex systems like rockets, autonomous robotics, and medical devices, most still wrestle with software from the desktop era in their daily jobs.

​​8:00 pm – Wrap-up & Closing Conversations

​Talk 1: Building Multi-Agentic AI Architecture on Langflow by Melissa Herrera, Developer Relations Engineer at DataStax (now IBM) on the Langflow team

Talk 1 Details: This talk shows you how to build multi-agent workflows in Langflow that actually work together seamlessly. I'll walk through orchestrating agents, integrating real-time data with tools like Composio and Astra DB, and share the hard-learned lessons / common pitfalls from building these systems.

​Talk 2: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Deep Dive by Ramnivas Laddad of Exograph

Talk 2 Details: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful--but only when they have access to the right context. While techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) help bridge this gap, they remain limited in the types of questions they can answer and tasks they can perform. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this by providing an open, lightweight standard that connects AI models to real-time information and external tools. In this session, you'll get a hands-on introduction to MCP: how it works, how it seamlessly integrates LLMs with external systems, and how it fits into the broader AI tooling ecosystem. We'll explore working examples of MCP servers, watch a model interact with them to perform meaningful tasks, and get a preview of upcoming changes to the MCP specification--making this session ideal for developers aiming to build more capable, context-aware, and responsive AI applications.

​Talk 2 Speaker Bio: Ramnivas is a technologist, author, and presenter passionate about doing software right. He has been at the forefront of innovation in the Spring Framework and Cloud Foundry since their inception, leading a group within Cloud Foundry and founding the Spring Cloud project. He is the author of AspectJ in Action (1st and 2nd editions), the best-selling book on aspect-oriented programming. Ramnivas has spoken at leading industry events including JavaOne, ScalaDays, JavaPolis, SpringOne, and O'Reilly OSCON. He is also the co-founder of Exograph, a Rust-powered framework that enables developers to expose data sources like Postgres to LLMs via MCP, offering a secure, structured, and policy-aware integration.

​Join us for an intimate fireside chat with Zach Coelius, 4x founder and Managing Partner at Coelius Capital, in conversation with Luna Maroun, Product Manager at Adobe, as we explore what it really takes to go from zero to something - when all you have is a deck, and a dream.

​We’ll unpack:

​Finding Your First 10 – How to land early users without a product or a marketing budget

​Founder psychology – The mindset shifts that separate durable founders from the rest and the traits investors look for when there’s no product

​Selling as a technical founder – Why engineers can be the best storytellers (with the right tools)

​Early momentum – What traction actually looks like in the first 90 days

​Real stories from Zach’s portfolio - What actually landed the first users

​Whether you're building in stealth, pre-product, or still at the idea stage - this conversation will offer honest insights, war stories, and tactics to help you get started the right way.

​I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.

I like to think
(right now, please!)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully
past computers
as if they were flowers
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think
(it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace."

​We’re excited to invite you to a private gathering of senior engineering and technology executives at the Unusual Ventures Thought Leadership Dinner. This exclusive event is designed to catalyze strategic conversations at the intersection of AI, privacy, and data security—where emerging risks meet transformative opportunities.

​You’ll be joining a select group of 16 technology leaders, including:

​John Vrionis, Managing Partner, Unusual Ventures
Niamh O'Donnell, Director of Programs, Unusual Ventures
Abhi Sharma, CEO and Co-Founder, Relyance AI

​Additional guests include top engineering and security minds from leading AI-forward organizations.

​Venue details will be shared directly with registered attendees.

​Topic: The Convergence of Privacy, Data Security, and AI Governance

​As generative and agentic AI systems increasingly influence core business operations, enterprises face a critical challenge: balancing innovation with accountability. The convergence of privacy, data security, and AI governance is no longer a theoretical discussion—it’s a boardroom mandate.

​Next-generation AI architectures require more than technical sophistication; they demand trust, transparency, and resilience. Privacy-preserving machine learning, secure model training, and real-time risk detection are rapidly becoming table stakes. Simultaneously, regulatory expectations around explainability, consent, and data lineage are reshaping how engineering leaders must design and deploy AI systems.

​For Heads of ML, CISOs, and technology executives, this moment calls for intentional leadership:

​How do we build systems that are not only intelligent, but inherently trustworthy?

​How do we future-proof our data and AI pipelines for a fragmented global compliance landscape?

​And how can we embed governance into AI development without slowing down innovation?

​This executive roundtable will unpack these strategic imperatives:

​What architectural principles drive AI systems that are secure, private by design, and auditable at scale?

​How can companies align AI governance with data strategy to create sustainable competitive advantage?

​What best practices are emerging across high-stakes industries—and what lessons can we learn from early adopters?

​Join us for a candid, high-impact discussion on operationalizing trustworthy AI at scale—where security, privacy, and governance are not afterthoughts, but foundational design pillars."

Turn your Codex agents into a production-grade coding team with a cloud backend,https://lu.ma/xpander-ai-agentops-workshop,"This workshop teaches developers how to deploy and manage open-source Codex coding agents in a production-ready cloud environment using xpander.ai and AgentOps.ai for scalability, observability, and collaboration, transforming individual agents into a fully functional team.  Attendees will build and deploy cloud-based agent workflows in a hands-on session, requiring laptops and specific pre-installed extensions.","AWS Builder Loft, 525 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA",California,xpander.ai,2025-07-03,05:30 AM,"July 02, 2025",08:30 PM,Tech & AI,0.0,"​Open-source coding agents are ready for production - if you give them the runtime they deserve.

​​If you’ve already tried Codex, you know it’s powerful - but turning it into a reliable developer sidekick requires significant effort. You’ll need to manage sessions, handle long-running tasks, secure sandbox and terminal access, integrate with third-party services like GitHub and deal with A2A to allow multi-agents deployments so you can build a team of coding agents.

​​This workshop is for developers and AI agent builders who want to run open-source coding agents in the cloud, as part of a team, with the right infrastructure behind them.

​​We’ll walk through how to take local coding agents and run them with a proper backend: secure runtimes, persistent memory, triggers via MCP right from your IDE, and multi-agent orchestration using A2A (Agent-to-Agent). No more running brittle scripts on your laptop. No more glue code. Just real infrastructure, ready to scale your agents from toy to teammate.

​​We’ll use xpander.ai, backend-as-a-service for agents, to set up, deploy, and orchestrate coding agents that can interact, share state, and get real work done even when you're offline. We’ll use AgentOps for observability, to monitor, debug, and understand our AI agents' behavior with time-travel session replays, prompt-level insights, and detailed traces of tool calls, errors, and token usage.

​​In under three hours, you’ll go from zero to running agent workflows that are cloud-deployed, event-triggered, and fully observable.

​​Agenda:

​​5:00–5:30 PM | Gathering, snacks, networking
5:30–5:50 PM | Tech talk 1: The three most important things you need for running coding agents in the cloud
5:50–6:10 PM | Demo 1: xpander.ai
6:10–6:30 PM | Demo 2: AgentOps.ai
6:30–8:00 PM | Hands-on workshop - build it on your own
7:00 | Pizza is served 🍕

​Speakers: Sonali Mishra & Shalin Patel (Nutanix)
Abstract: Handling workloads that require GPU on Kubernetes has become easier with tools like NVIDIA’s GPU Operator but deploying them in production across real-world environments brings hidden challenges. In this session, we will share lessons learned from managing GPU across different infrastructures including on-prem and across public clouds, air-gapped environments, and different Operating Systems. We will cover compatibility issues with drivers and runtimes, discovering GPU attached nodes and scheduling GPU workloads on Kubernetes clusters. We will also discuss our experience working with vGPUs, the challenges of enabling multi-tenancy, dynamic resource allocation and monitoring. And lastly, we will talk about how we addressed some of these challenges using the NVIDIA GPU operator and our Kubernetes operator for vGPU tokens and license management. This talk is ideal for platform engineers and architects bringing AI/ML to Kubernetes, and looking to scale GPU use efficiently, securely and with better observability.

We also have some exclusive and priority access and rewards planned for those who RSVP-ed early. - Varun

​A backstory on why we at Hyperspace have been building it:

​the idea of an agentic browser pokes at the idea of how do the agents rank and utilize each other in order to best serve users. we believe this compounds user utility over time. Search engines have built-in network effects: more people use the web, the smarter they (ought to) become with more credible websites “voting” for webpages in an uber-democratic real-time process. this compounds and compresses society’s knowledge.

​is it true with single-shot AI answer engines which are wrapping search results ? you ask a question, get generated answer and move on - how does that feedback into making the underlying system a lot smarter over time ? what has it learnt about that page compared to other pages which fundamentally improves the experience for the Nth user ?

​for example - consider the “rental car” problem. 

​1) enter that term in a search engine like Google, what do you get ? list of top car rental websites

​2) enter it in an answer engine, what do you get ? you get English-ized version of (1) above. great, now you know the names of the biggest rental car companies in the US. as a user, you are basically back at (1) above. 

​what did you as a user really want ? you wanted the best rental car options for you and also things happening leading to a booking: based on your needs and preferences. so right answer for you would have been a series of actions:

​- a question: which city do you need this in and approximately when ? what kind of cars do you like to drive ? 

​- found you these Tesla Model 3 rentals, available on these dates for this price, and booking available on these few websites and apps, 

​- and i will re-run this analysis every 30 mts for next 2 weeks until your travel to see if can find you a better price and negotiate behind the scenes 

​this, is the next society productivity unlock as this is the flow the user would have been the MOST happiest with. that is the 5 star user experience. and that’s only going to happen in the most seamless way in a software system custom-designed for this purpose, an agentic browser, which leverages AI agents (nameless processes recursively spanning and orchestrating themselves using all types of infrastructure necessary in order to satisfy the user need). 

​where a search engine and an answer engine “gives up” after showing rudimentary options, the agentic browser is a relentless beast of a machine which keeps on running and processing, and orchestrating many agents together into getting the job done for the user. during this time, it is learning and compounding on the nature of agents and their interactions themselves’. it is not just a standalone software, but a network, and it requires a different DNA altogether. 

​this is the world we are building, and it spans many components: from a revolutionary new user interface, to insanely powerful on-device capabilities, to plugging into the world’s largest distributed data and compute cluster, and using the right decentralized protocols for agent-to-agent transactions and payments to build trust in the system. 

​this is going to be the largest new economy built from scratch this decade."

​Rails as the One Person Framework

​AI-assisted coding has exploded onto the scene, promising to amplify what solo devs can do. Ruby on Rails is the perfect partner for this approach. Rails has long been known as the one-person framework, a powerful toolkit designed to give lone developers and small teams superpowers, compressing the time and knowledge needed to ship big features

​This Ruby AI hackathon is about exploring that vision: how AI can make building a Rails app even more of a one-person show! Some participants might even experiment with voice coding setups – it’s all about exploring new ways to build with Ruby.

​Current plans

​You can work solo as part of a small team. Bring your own application idea to life or choose from several project prompts we’ll provide if you need inspiration. Throughout the day, mentors will be on hand to help with technical issues, brainstorm AI solutions, or just cheer you on. We’re working on bringing special guests from the Ruby AI community joining as mentors and judges.

​As an all-day event, we’ll have breaks for lunch and snacks. At the end of the day, each individual or team will get to demo their app and briefly show off their code. A panel of judges will evaluate each project and provide encouraging feedback. They’ll be looking at creativity, use of the theme, and technical achievement given the time constraints.

​Ready to hack? RSVP now!

​Sounds exciting? We sure hope so! RSVP on our Meetup page here so we can get a headcount. If you have any questions, feel free to drop by our Ruby SF Slack channel. Otherwise, just bring your laptop on July 19 and get ready to code with vibes."

Next Protest at OpenAI,https://lu.ma/rxyplaok,"This protest aims to shut down OpenAI, citing existential risks associated with the company's pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  Experts warn of significant probabilities of human extinction due to AGI, fueling the call for government intervention and a permanent ban on AGI development.  The event targets those concerned about the potential dangers of advanced AI.","1455 3rd St, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA",California,Stop AI Events,2025-07-26,05:00 AM,"July 25, 2025",06:30 PM,Tech & AI,0.0,"​Shut down OpenAI

​​​​Help us say, ""Close OpenAI!"" OpenAI is the company leading the race to smarter-than-human AI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), i.e., an AI that is smarter than all human experts across all technical domains. 2,700 cited AI researchers said in a poll that there is a 19% chance of AGI causing human extinction, and Geoffrey Hinton, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in AI in 2024, says there is a 50% chance of AGI causing human extinction. Some experts, like Dr. Roman Yampolskiy, say the risk of extinction is 99.99%. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, when asked about the worst case for AGI, said it could be, ""lights out for all of us."" Sam Altman has also said AGI will arrive in 2025. It is impossible to have experimental evidence that the behavior of an AGI will stay safe indefinitely and that AGI will never want something that will lead to our extinction similar to how we as Homo Sapiens often caused the extinction of many less intelligent species. We demand that the US government shut down OpenAI, close any other company building AGI, and permanently ban the development of AGI."

​🪞 Can you read my mind? (No, but you're probably trying.)

​Join us at Wave Collective for a conversation with Juliana Schroeder, social psychologist and professor at UC Berkeley, as we explore the science behind how we connect—and misconnect—with others.

​Every meaningful moment in life involves a social interaction. But despite the immense psychological and practical value we can gain from other people, we often leave connection on the table. Why?

​In this talk, we’ll dive into the surprising mistakes people make when trying to read others’ minds—and how that impacts everything from forming friendships with strangers to disagreeing more productively. Along the way, we'll uncover how small, prosocial gestures can go a long way and why even minimal connections can mean more than you think.

​Come for the psychology, stay for the practical takeaways—and leave with a new lens on how we interact and connect. 🧠✨

When people from different backgrounds, cultures, genders, and experiences lead organizations, innovation follows. Diverse leaders don’t just bring new ideas — they bring new perspectives that challenge the status quo and elevate everyone around them.

​Join industry leaders from Stanford Alumni Association Women’s Impact Network (WIN), Harvard Business School Association of Northern California (HBS), Bay Area Alumni Network of the Carnegie Mellon Alumni Association, and the Princeton Club of Northern California (PCNC) as they discuss topics such as:

​How diversity influences the way in which they lead their organizations from the top;

​Why their own diverse backgrounds and experiences matter in how they approach managing others;

​Lessons they learned and things they would have done differently when they were up and coming in their careers; and

​What they are looking for next in their professional and personal lives in terms of balance and growth.

​A boardroom with varied voices and backgrounds is a boardroom equipped for global impact and profitability.  A team rooted in inclusivity is a team empowered to see new opportunities where others see obstacles. Representation isn't just a value — it's a strategic advantage.  Join us for this informational panel and networking session to learn more.

Ideal for students and researchers interested in genetic engineering and gene therapy.","Frontier Tower | Berlinhouse, 995 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA",California,The Biopunk Community,2025-06-25,07:00 AM,"June 24, 2025",08:30 PM,Education & Research,0.0,"​​Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is a gene-editing tool that allows scientists to modify an organism’s DNA. The system is based on a naturally occurring defense mechanism found in bacteria to fight off viral invaders by cutting their DNA.

​​The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two main components: the Cas9 protein, which acts as a molecular scissor, and a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the Cas9 protein to a specific target sequence in the DNA. When the Cas9 protein and the gRNA are introduced into a cell, the gRNA binds to the target DNA sequence, guiding the Cas9 protein to make a precise cut in the DNA, technically referred to as DNA double-strand break (DSB) later. Once the DNA is cut, the cell’s own repair machinery attempts to fix the break, which can result in the inactivation of a gene.

​​In this laboratory, we will explore the cutting-edge CRISPR-prime editing system, a powerful tool for genetic engineering that enables insertions, deletions, and substitutions in target DNA sequences without introducing double-strand breaks. Particularly, this experiment will demonstrate how to practically perform gene deletion using CRISPR editing in E. coli which can be broadly applied to other designs for various applications. This system has broad applications in both basic research and biotechnology, including gene therapy, metabolic engineering, and the development of novel organisms with unique characteristics."

Grunwald will discuss innovative solutions and the challenges of balancing food production with environmental sustainability. Ideal for climate activists, food system professionals, and anyone concerned about the future of our planet.","9Zero Climate Innovation Hub, 350 California St 4th floor, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",California,9Zero Climate Innovation Hub - San Francisco,2025-07-18,01:00 AM,"July 17, 2025",01:30 PM,Networking & Community,0.0,"​Bring your lunch and join climate journalist and author Mike Grunwald at 9Zero SF for a discussion and celebration of the launch of his new book, ""We Are Eating the Earth,"" available on July 1!

​About the book:

​From the author of New York Times bestseller The New New Deal, a groundbreaking piece of reportage from the trenches of the next climate war: the fight to fix our food system.

Humanity has cleared a land mass the size of Asia plus Europe to grow food, and our food system generates a third of our carbon emissions. By 2050, we’re going to need a lot more calories to fill nearly 10 billion bellies, but we can’t feed the world without frying it if we keep tearing down an acre of rainforest every six seconds. We are eating the earth, and the greatest challenge facing our species will be to slow our relentless expansion of farmland into nature. Even if we quit fossil fuels, we’ll keep hurtling towards climate chaos if we don’t solve our food and land problems.

In this rollicking, shocking narrative, Grunwald shows how the world, after decades of ignoring the climate problem at the center of our plates, has pivoted to making it worse, embracing solutions that sound sustainable but could make it even harder to grow more food with less land. But he also tells the stories of the dynamic scientists and entrepreneurs pursuing real solutions, from a jungle-tough miracle crop called pongamia to genetically-edited cattle embryos, from Impossible Whoppers to a non-polluting pesticide that uses the technology behind the COVID vaccines to constipate beetles to death. It’s an often infuriating saga of lobbyists, politicians, and even the scientific establishment making terrible choices for humanity, but it’s also a hopeful account of the people figuring out what needs to be done—and trying to do it.

Michael Grunwald, bestselling author of The Swamp and The New New Deal, builds his narrative around a brilliant, relentless, unforgettable food and land expert named Tim Searchinger. He chronicles Searchinger’s uphill battles against bad science and bad politics, both driven by the overwhelming influence of agricultural interests. And he illuminates a path that could save our planetary home for ourselves and future generations—through better policy, technology, and behavior, as well as a new land ethic recognizing that every acre matters.

​Event Description:
AI adoption isn’t free, and it’s not just about compute costs. From cloud infrastructure and model retraining to talent upskilling and compliance guardrails, the economics of enterprise AI are layered, evolving, and often misunderstood.

​Join us for an exclusive in-person executive roundtable on The Economics of AI, hosted by AI Realized, where senior leaders will dig into the real costs—and real returns—of deploying AI across the enterprise.

​This roundtable is for executives leading internal AI deployments in product, engineering, marketing, operations, finance, HR, supply chain, or other functional groups.

​Each roundtable will engage in expert-facilitated, peer-to-peer discussion. Together, we’ll explore how organizations are making the business case for AI, tracking ROI, and building cost-aware, impact-focused AI strategies.

​We’ll tackle questions like:

​What’s the true Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of enterprise AI?

​Where do hidden costs show up—and how do you forecast them?

​How are leaders calculating ROI on AI investments?

​What “soft” investments—like talent development and governance—have proven essential?

​Who owns the AI budget: IT, Finance, or Business Units?

​Who Should Attend:
This roundtable is designed for C-level and VP-level executives leading AI strategy and deployment within their organizations.

​Why Attend:

​Learn how your peers are measuring AI value and managing spend

​Share lessons from early deployments and cost surprises

​Bring back concrete ideas for budgeting, governance, and executive alignment

​Participate in a trusted, off-the-record environment curated for impact

​Program:

​9:00 AM - Check in, coffee, networking
